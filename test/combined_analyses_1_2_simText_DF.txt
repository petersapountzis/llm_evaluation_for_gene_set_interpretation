These proteins work together to regulate various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration."	Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signaling	"The most prominent biological process performed by the interacting proteins ERBB2, ERBB4, FGFR2, FGFR4, HRAS, and KRAS is receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling. This process is critical for cellular growth, differentiation, and survival.

1. ERBB2 and ERBB4: Both proteins belong to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, which are receptor tyrosine kinases. They play a crucial role in cell proliferation and differentiation by binding to specific ligands, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. ERBB2 is known to form heterodimers with other EGFR family members, enhancing the signaling capacity of the receptor complex.

2. FGFR2 and FGFR4: These proteins are members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, which are also receptor tyrosine kinases. They are involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and migration. FGFR2 and FGFR4 bind to fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), leading to receptor dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways.

3. HRAS and KRAS: Both proteins are members of the RAS family of small GTPases, which function as molecular switches in various signaling pathways, including the RTK signaling pathway. They are involved in transmitting signals from activated RTKs to downstream effectors, such as the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. HRAS and KRAS are known to play a critical role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

In conclusion, the interacting proteins ERBB2, ERBB4, FGFR2, FGFR4, HRAS, and KRAS are involved in the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, which is essential for cellular growth, differentiation, and survival. This process is initiated by the binding of specific ligands to the receptor tyrosine kinases (ERBB2, ERBB4, FGFR2, and FGFR4), leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, mediated by the small GTPases HRAS and KRAS."	1	0.9943519	Exact Match	Very similar
