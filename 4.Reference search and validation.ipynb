      "Primary lipodystrophies represent a heterogeneous group of very rare diseases with a prevalence of less than 1 case for 100.000, inherited or acquired, caracterized by a loss of body fat either generalized or localized (lipoatrophy). In some forms, lipoatrophy is associated with a selective hypertrophy of other fat depots. Clinical signs of insulin resistance are often present: acanthosis nigricans, signs of hyperandrogenism. All lipodystrophies are associated with dysmetabolic alterations with insulin resistance, altered glucose tolerance or diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia leading to a risk of acute pancreatitis. Chronic complications are those resulting from diabetes involving the retina, kidney and nerves, cardiovascular complications and steatotic liver lesions that could result in cirrhosis. Genetic forms of generalized lipodystrophy (or Berardinelli-Seip syndrome) result, in most cases, from recessive mutations in one of two genes: either BSCL2 coding seipin or BSCL1 coding AGPAT2, an acyl-transferase involved in triglyceride synthesis. Acquired generalized lipodystrophy (Lawrence syndrome) is of unknown origin but is sometimes associated with signs of autoimmunity. Partial lipodystrophies can be familial with dominant transmission. Heterozygous mutations have been identified in the LMNA gene encoding nuclear lamin A/C belonging to the nuclear lamina, or in PPARG encoding the adipogenic transcription factor PPARgamma. Some less typical lipodystrophies, associated with signs of premature aging, have been linked to mutations in LMNA or in the ZMPSTE24 gene encoding the protease responsible for the maturation of prelamin A into lamin A. Acquired partial lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons syndrome) is characterized by cephalothoracic fat loss. Its aetiology is unknown but mutations in LMNB2, encoding the lamina protein lamin B2, could represent susceptibility factors. Highly active antiretroviral treatments for HIV infection are currently the most frequent cause of acquired secondary lipodystrophic syndromes. The genetic diagnosis is performed in specialized laboratories and, in the most severe forms, antenatal diagnosis could be proposed. Treatment of diabetes, dyslipidemia and complications involves the classical intervention strategies. Insulino-sensitizing drugs are useful. Therapeutic trials with recombinant human leptin in patients with very low leptin levels reported good results with respect to the metabolic and liver alterations. The prognosis is linked to the precocity and severity of the diabetic, cardiovascular and liver complications.\n",

      "Genome-wide association studies linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the MYH9 locus to chronic kidney disease among African-Americans, particularly glomerular diseases such as HIV nephropathy and idiopathic focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). However, these MYH9 SNPs are intronic, and despite extensive sequencing, a causal variant remains elusive. To investigate the role of MYH9 in kidney disease, we selectively deleted Myh9 from mouse podocytes and found that mutant C57BL/6 mice did not develop renal insufficiency or proteinuria compared to control littermates, even when the mice were aged for 9 months. To explain the surprisingly normal phenotype, we considered genetic redundancy with the paralog Myh10 in podocytes, but we found that Myh10 was not expressed in podocytes in Myh9-deficient or control mice. We tested whether Myh9 podocyte deletion predisposed mice to glomerulopathy in response to injury by doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin), and we found that Myh9 podocyte-deleted mice developed proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, while control mice were resistant. In summary, Myh9 podocyte deletion in C57BL/6 mice results in susceptibility to experimental doxorubicin hydrochloride glomerulopathy. We review evidence that MYH9 dysfunction in humans results in similar susceptibility and place our data, the first examination of Myh9 kidney disease in experimental animals, in the context of recent findings in human kidney disease, including the role of APOL1.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "<b>Background:</b> The spliceosome plays an important role in mRNA alternative splicing and is aberrantly expressed in several tumors. However, the potential roles of spliceosome-related genes in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly understood. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Patient data were acquired from public databases. Expression differences and survival analyses were used to assess the importance of spliceosome-related genes in HCC prognosis. To explore the potential regulatory mechanisms of these genes, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed and screened using univariate and multivariate Cox regression and random forest analyses. This was used to create a five-gene prognostic model. The prognostic value and predictive power of the five-gene signature were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analyses in the training set. These results were further validated in an independent external set. To facilitate clinical application, a nomogram was prepared to predict the overall survival of HCC patients. The relative expression of five genes was detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. <b>Results:</b> The analysis revealed that <i>LSM1-7, SNRPB, SNRPD1-3, SNRPE, SNRPF, SNRPG,</i> and <i>SNRPN</i> could be used as prognostic biomarkers in HCC patients. Moreover, the five-gene risk model could clearly distinguish between the high-and low-risk groups. Furthermore, the risk model was associated with the tumor mutation burden, immune cell infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, natural killer T cells, M2 macrophages, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, which also demonstrated the predictive efficacy of this risk model in HCC immunotherapy. <b>Conclusion:</b> Spliceosome-related genes and the five-gene signature could serve as novel prognostic biomarkers for HCC patients, aiding clinical patient monitoring and follow-up.\n",

      "The aim of the present study was to characterise key enzymes involved in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthesis in the testis and epididymis collected from 2-year-old healthy warmblood stallions (n=10). The mRNA expression of fatty acid synthase, the Δ9-, Δ6-, Δ5- and Δ4-desaturases and elongases 6, 5 and 2 (encoded by the fatty acid synthase (FASN), the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), the fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2), the fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1), the delta 4-desaturase, sphingolipid 1 (DEGS1), ELOVL fatty acid elongase 6(ELOVL6), ELOVL fatty acid elongase 5 (ELOVL5), ELOVL fatty acid elongase 2 (ELOVL2) genes respectively) was determined in equine testis and epididymis. All enzymes were present in testicular tissue and along the epididymis, but mRNA expression differed among localisations. The protein localisation of FADS1, FADS2 and ELOVL5 was determined by immunohistochemistry. In the testes, FADS1 was expressed in the germinal cells and ELOVL5 was expressed in germinal and Leydig cells; FADS2 was not detected. In the epididymis, FADS1 and FADS2 were expressed in the principal and basal cells, whereas ELOVL5 was found only in the principal cells of the caput. All three enzymes were present in epididymal vesicles secreted by an apocrine mechanism. These results suggest active PUFA metabolism during spermatogenesis and epididymal sperm maturation in stallions.\n",

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to compare the fatty acid composition and lipid metabolism-related genes expression in breast muscle of Jianchang duck (J), Cherry Verry duck (CV) and 3 crossbred strains (BH1, BH2 and MC♂ × (BGF2♂  × GF2♀)♀ (MBG)). Our results showed that the breast muscle of J had the highest contents of C22:1(n-9) but the lowest ratios of Ʃ-omega 6 (Ʃn-6)/Ʃ-omega 3 (Ʃn-3), Ʃ-mono-unsaturated fatty acid (ƩMUFA)/Ʃ-saturated fatty acid (ƩSFA) and Ʃ-polyunsaturated fatty acid (ƩPUFA)/ƩSFA. The ƩPUFA/ƩSFA ratio was higher in breast muscle of MBG than in that of BH2 and CV, and the contents of C22:1(n-9), ƩMUFA and ƩPUFA were higher in BH1 than in BH2 and CV. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of SCD1, FADS2, ELOVL2, and ELOVL5 were significantly higher in MBG (P < 0.05), while those of FASD1 and ACACA were significantly higher in BH1 than in BH2 and CV (P < 0.05). Principal component analysis showed that fatty acids variation exhibited extensive positive loading on principal components (PCs). Correlation analysis showed that PC1 and PC3 of BH1, as well as PC1 of MBG were correlated with the mRNA levels of ACACA and FABP3, respectively. Thus, it could be concluded that the breast muscles of MBG and BH1 have better fatty acid composition, which was closely related to the increased expression levels of SCD1, FADS2, ELOVL2, and ELOVL5 genes in MBG but FADS1 and ACACA in BH1. Moreover, these results also showed that crossbreeding could optimize the composition of fatty acid in breast muscle of ducks.\n",

      "Increased production of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFA) can have a positive effect on the nutritional value of ruminant milk for human consumption. In nonruminant species, fatty acid elongase 5 (ELOVL5) is a key enzyme for endogenous synthesis of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids. However, whether ELOVL5 protein plays a role (if any) in ruminant mammary tissue remains unclear. In the present study, we assessed the mRNA abundance of ELOVL5 at 3 stages of lactation in goat mammary tissue. Results revealed that ELOVL5 had the lowest expression at peak lactation compared with the nonlactating and late-lactating periods. The ELOVL5 was overexpressed or knocked down to assess its role in goat mammary epithelial cells. Results revealed that ELOVL5 overexpression increased the expression of perilipin2 (PLIN2) and decreased diacylglycerolacyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) and fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) mRNA, but had no effect on the expression of DGAT1, FADS1, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). Overexpression of ELOVL5 decreased the concentration of C16:1n-7, whereas no significant change in C18:1n-7 and C18:1n-9 was observed. Knockdown of ELOVL5 decreased the expression of PLIN2 but had no effect on DGAT1, DGAT2, FADS1, FADS2, and SCD1 mRNA expression. Knockdown of ELOVL5 increased the concentration of C16:1n-7 and decreased that of C18:1n-7. The alterations of expression of genes related to lipid metabolism after overexpression or knockdown of ELOVL5 suggested a negative feedback regulation by the products of ELOVL5 activation. However, the content of triacylglycerol was not altered by knockdown or overexpression of ELOVL5 in goat mammary epithelial cells, which might have been due to the insufficient availability of substrate in vitro. Collectively, these are the first in vitro results highlighting an important role of ELOVL5 in the elongation of 16-carbon to 18-carbon unsaturated fatty acids in ruminant mammary cells.\n",

      "Perturbations in lipid metabolism characterize many of the chronic diseases currently plaguing our society, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Thus interventions that target plasma lipid levels remain a primary goal to manage these diseases. The determinants of plasma lipid levels are multi-factorial, consisting of both genetic and lifestyle components. Recent evidence indicates that fatty acid desaturases have an important role in defining plasma and tissue lipid profiles. This review will highlight the current state-of-knowledge regarding three desaturases (Scd-1, Fads1 and Fads2) and their potential roles in disease onset and development. Although research in rodent models has provided invaluable insight into the regulation and functions of these desaturases, the extent to which murine research can be translated to humans remains unclear. Evidence emerging from human-based research demonstrates that genetic variation in human desaturase genes affects enzyme activity and, consequently, disease risk factors. Moreover, this genetic variation may have a trans-generational effect via breastfeeding. Therefore inter-individual variation in desaturase function is attributed to both genetic and lifestyle components. As such, population-based research regarding the role of desaturases on disease risk is challenged by this complex gene-lifestyle paradigm. Unravelling the contribution of each component is paramount for understanding the inter-individual variation that exists in plasma lipid profiles, and will provide crucial information to develop personalized strategies to improve health management.\n",

      "In this study, we conducted a 56-d feeding trial to investigate the effects of replacing the fish oil (FO) with palm oil (PO) on the performance, tissue fatty acid (FA) composition, and mRNA levels of genes related to hepatic lipid metabolism in grouper (<i>Epinephelus coioides</i>). Five isolipidic (13% crude lipid) and isonitrogenous (48% CP) diets were formulated by incrementally adding PO to the control diet (25% fish meal and 9% added FO) to replace FO in the control diets. Triplicate groups of 30 groupers (initial weight: 12.6 ± 0.1 g) were fed one of the diets twice daily, to apparent satiety. The replacement of FO with 50% PO revealed maximum growth without affecting the performance and whole-body proximate compositions, and replacing FO with 100% PO revealed a comparable (<i>P</i> > 0.05) growth with that of the control diet, suggesting PO as a suitable alternative to FO. The analysis of FA profiles in the dorsal muscle and liver though reflected the FA profile of the diet, PO substitutions above 50% could compromise (<i>P</i> < 0.05) the FA profile in the liver and flesh of the fish species in comparison with the control diet. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of <i>FAS</i>, <i>G6PD</i>, <i>LPL</i>, <i>PPARΑ</i>, and <i>Δ6FAD</i> genes in the liver had positive linear and/or quadratic responses, but the <i>SCD</i>, <i>HSL</i>, <i>ATGL</i>, <i>FABP</i>, <i>SREBP-1C</i> and <i>ELOVL5</i> had the opposite trend, with increasing dietary PO inclusion levels, whereas the mRNA level of <i>ACC</i> was not affected by dietary treatments. The optimal level of PO substitution for FO was estimated to be 47.1% of the feed, based on the regression analysis of percent weight gains against dietary PO inclusion levels; however, it might affect the FA profile in the liver and flesh of the fish species, and further study is required to investigate whether the changes in tissue FA composition will affect the welfare and market value over a production cycle of grouper.\n",

      "Despite the recent advances in transcriptomics, gene expression studies addressing cattle´s skeletal muscle adaptations in response to compensatory growth are warranted, particularly regarding lipid metabolism due to its impact in meat sensory and nutritional traits. In the present study, in comparison to ad libitum feeding, a period of feed restriction was used in order to understand the changes in bull´s lipid metabolism and gene expression of the adipogenic and lipogenic pathways after re-alimentation. Thus, 40 young Alentejana bulls were either fed ad libitum (CG group) from 9 to 18 months of age or subjected to food restriction from 9 to 15 months of age, and fed ad libitum until 24 months of age (DG group). The intramuscular fat (IMF) and total fatty acids (FA) contents were similar between groups. The major FA (>2%) contents were similar (16:0, 16:1c9, 18:1c9 and 18:2n-6) between treatments with the exception of 18:0 content that was 15% lower in DG than in CG and 20:4n-6 that tended to be greater on DG bulls. Regarding minor FA (<2%), the DG group presented greater proportions (P<0.01) of 17:1c9, 18:1t9, 18:1t10 (, 18:1c11), 18:1c13, 18:3n-6, 22:0, 22:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 and lower (P<0.05) proportions of 20:0, 18:1t16+c14, and branched chain FA (iso-15:0, anteiso-15:0, iso-16:0 and anteiso-17:0) than the CG group. Delta-9 desaturase activity indices were consistently greater (P<0.05) in DG, when compared to the CG group. Regarding microarray analysis, differentially expressed genes between CG and DG bulls were grouped in 5 main biological functions: lipid and nucleic acid metabolisms, small molecule biochemistry, molecular transport and translational modification. Discontinuous growth down-regulated the expression of ACACB (FC (fold-change) = 1.32), FABP3 (FC = 1.45), HADHA (FC = 1.41) and SLC37A4 (FC = 1.40) genes, when compared to the CG system (FDR<0.05). In contrast, in the CG bulls, the expression of ELOVL5 (FC = 1.58) and FASN (FC = 1.71) was down-regulated when compared to DG bulls. These results were confirmed to be significant (P<0.05) in the case of ELOVL5, FASN and SLC37A4, and almost significant for FABP3 by qRT-PCR analysis. The SCD1 and SCD5 gene expressions were not found to be affected by growth path. These results contribute to the still scarce knowledge about the mechanisms involved in fatty acid metabolism during compensatory growth which have decisive role on meat quality produced in Mediterranean areas.\n",

      "1. The objective of this study was to characterise the regulation of the pathways that synthesise long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on developing adipose deposits in broiler embryos and chicks. Subcutaneous adipose depots were harvested from embryos and embryonic d E13, E15 and E17. Subcutaneous, abdominal and crop (neck) adipose, as well as liver, were collected at 7 and 14 d post-hatch. 2. Targeted RNA sequencing was used to quantify expression of 6 elongation of very long-chain fatty acid (<i>ELOVL</i>) genes, two isoforms of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (<i>SCD</i> and <i>SCD5</i>), and three fatty acid desaturases (<i>FADS1, FADS2</i>, and <i>FADS6</i>) in each depot and in the liver. Expression levels of marker genes for fatty acid oxidation and adipogenesis (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (<i>PPARG</i>)) were quantified. Fatty acid composition of subcutaneous adipose was analysed using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). 3. Genes in the PUFA synthetic pathway were differentially expressed across developmental ages and between depots. These include elongase and desaturase genes, that have not previously been characterised in chicken. Correlation analyses identified subsets of co-regulated genes and fatty acids and highlighted relationships that may influence adipose metabolism and development. 4. It was concluded that PUFA synthesis is an active and dynamically regulated pathway in developing adipose deposits in the broiler chick. These data highlighted potential novel roles for specific elongase and desaturase genes in adipose deposition and metabolism.\n",

      "With the increasing concern for health and nutrition, dietary fat has attracted considerable attention. The composition of fatty acids in a diet is important since they are associated with major diseases, such as cancers, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) requires the expression of dietary fat-associated genes, such as SCD, FADS1, FADS2, and FADS3, which encode a variety of desaturases, to catalyze the addition of a double bond in a fatty acid chain. Recent studies using new molecular techniques and genomics, as well as clinical trials have shown that these genes and UFA are closely related to physiological conditions and chronic diseases; it was found that the existence of alternative transcripts of the desaturase genes and desaturase isoforms might affect human health and lipid metabolism in different ways. In this review, we provide an overview of UFA and desaturases associated with human health and nutrition. Moreover, recent findings of UFA, desaturases, and their associated genes in human systems are discussed. Consequently, this review may help elucidate the complicated physiology of UFA in human health and diseases.\n",

      "Goat milk is increasingly recognized by consumers due to its high nutritional value, richness in short- and medium-chain fatty acids, and richness in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Exogenous supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an important approach to increasing the content of PUFA in goat milk. Several studies have reported benefits of dietary DHA in terms of human health, including potential against chronic diseases and tumors. However, the mechanisms whereby an increased supply of DHA regulates mammary cell function is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of DHA on lipid metabolism processes in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC) and the function of H3K9ac epigenetic modifications in this process. Supplementation of DHA promoted lipid droplet accumulation increased the DHA content and altered fatty acid composition in GMEC. Lipid metabolism processes were altered by DHA supplementation through transcriptional programs in GMEC. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that DHA induced genome-wide H3K9ac epigenetic changes in GMEC. Multiomics analyses (H3K9ac genome-wide screening and RNA-seq) revealed that DHA-induced expression of lipid metabolism genes (<i>FASN</i>, <i>SCD1</i>, <i>FADS1</i>, <i>FADS2</i>, <i>LPIN1</i>, <i>DGAT1</i>, <i>MBOAT2</i>), which were closely related with changes in lipid metabolism processes and fatty acid profiles, were regulated by modification of H3K9ac. In particular, DHA increased the enrichment of H3K9ac in the promoter region of <i>PDK4</i> and promoted its transcription, while <i>PDK4</i> inhibited lipid synthesis and activated AMPK signaling in GMEC. The activation of the expression of fatty acid metabolism-related genes <i>FASN</i>, <i>FADS2</i>, and <i>SCD1</i> and their upstream transcription factor <i>SREBP1</i> by the AMPK inhibitor was attenuated in <i>PDK4</i>-overexpressing GMEC. In conclusion, DHA alters lipid metabolism processes via H3K9ac modifications and the PDK4-AMPK-SREBP1 signaling axis in goat mammary epithelial cells, providing new insights into the mechanism through which DHA affects mammary cell function and regulates milk fat metabolism.\n",

      "Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent regulated necrosis mediated by lipid peroxidation. Cancer cells survive under metabolic stress conditions by altering lipid metabolism, which may alter their sensitivity to ferroptosis. However, the association between lipid metabolism and ferroptosis is not completely understood. In this study, we found that the expression of elongation of very long-chain fatty acid protein 5 (ELOVL5) and fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) is up-regulated in mesenchymal-type gastric cancer cells (GCs), leading to ferroptosis sensitization. In contrast, these enzymes are silenced by DNA methylation in intestinal-type GCs, rendering cells resistant to ferroptosis. Lipid profiling and isotope tracing analyses revealed that intestinal-type GCs are unable to generate arachidonic acid (AA) and adrenic acid (AdA) from linoleic acid. AA supplementation of intestinal-type GCs restores their sensitivity to ferroptosis. Based on these data, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) biosynthesis pathway plays an essential role in ferroptosis; thus, this pathway potentially represents a marker for predicting the efficacy of ferroptosis-mediated cancer therapy.\n",

      "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with cholesterol metabolism and may partly explain large inter-individual variability in intestinal cholesterol absorption and endogenous cholesterol synthesis rates.

In contrast, <i>NPC1L1</i> (rs217429 and rs217416) were significantly associated with serum lathosterol levels. The tag SNP in <i>HMGCR</i> (rs12916) and a SNP in <i>LBR</i> (rs12141732) were significantly associated with serum LDL-C concentrations. SNPs in the cholesterol absorption genes were not associated with serum LDL-C concentrations. SNPs in <i>CYP51A1, DHCR24, HSD17B7,</i> and <i>MSMO1</i> were not associated with the serum non-cholesterol sterols and LDL-C concentrations. Given the variable efficiency of cholesterol-lowering interventions, the identification of SNPs associated with cholesterol metabolism could be a step forward towards personalized approaches.\n",

      "This review describes the mouse knockout models of cholesterol synthesis, together with human malformations and drugs that target cholesterogenic enzymes. Generally, the sooner a gene acts in cholesterol synthesis, the earlier the phenotype occurs. Humans with loss of function of early cholesterogenic enzymes have not yet been described, and in the mouse, loss of Hmgcr is preimplantation lethal. Together, these results indicate that the widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering statins are potentially teratogenic. The Mvk knockout is early embryonic lethal in the mouse, the absence of Fdft1 is lethal at E9.5-12.5 dpc, while the Cyp51 knockouts die at 15.0 dpc. Fungal CYP51 inhibitor azoles are teratogenic in humans, potentially leading to symptoms of Antley-Bixler syndrome. The X-linked mutations in Nsdhl and Ebp are embryonic lethal in male mice, while heterozygous females are also affected. Consequently, the anticancer drugs, tamoxifen and toremifene, inhibiting human EBP, may be harmful in early pregnancy. The Dhcr7 and Dhcr24 knockout mice die shortly after birth, while humans survive with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome or desmosterolosis. Since cholesterol is essential for hedgehog signaling, disturbance of this pathway by antipsychotics and -depressants explains some drug side effects. In conclusion, defects in cholesterol synthesis are generally lethal in mice, while humans with impaired later steps of the pathway can survive with severe malformations. Evidence shows that drugs targeting or, by coincidence, inhibiting human cholesterol synthesis are better avoided in early pregnancy. Since some drugs with teratogenic potential still stay on the market, this should be avoided in new cholesterol-related drug development.\n",

      "From various screens, we found that Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) viral microRNAs (miRNAs) target several enzymes in the mevalonate/cholesterol pathway. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthase 1 (HMGCS1), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR [a rate-limiting step in the mevalonate pathway]), and farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1 [a committed step in the cholesterol branch]) are repressed by multiple KSHV miRNAs. Transfection of viral miRNA mimics in primary endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells [HUVECs]) is sufficient to reduce intracellular cholesterol levels; however, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting only HMGCS1 did not reduce cholesterol levels. This suggests that multiple targets are needed to perturb this tightly regulated pathway. We also report here that cholesterol levels were decreased in <i>de novo</i>-infected HUVECs after 7 days. This reduction is at least partially due to viral miRNAs, since the mutant form of KSHV lacking 10 of the 12 miRNA genes had increased cholesterol compared to wild-type infections. We hypothesized that KSHV is downregulating cholesterol to suppress the antiviral response by a modified form of cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). We found that the cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) gene, which is responsible for generating 25HC, had increased expression in <i>de novo</i>-infected HUVECs but was strongly suppressed in long-term latently infected cell lines. We found that 25HC inhibits KSHV infection when added exogenously prior to <i>de novo</i> infection. In conclusion, we found that multiple KSHV viral miRNAs target enzymes in the mevalonate pathway to modulate cholesterol in infected cells during latency. This repression of cholesterol levels could potentially be beneficial to viral infection by decreasing the levels of 25HC.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> A subset of viruses express unique microRNAs (miRNAs), which act like cellular miRNAs to generally repress host gene expression. A cancer virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, or human herpesvirus 8 [HHV-8]), encodes multiple miRNAs that repress gene expression of multiple enzymes that are important for cholesterol synthesis. In cells with these viral miRNAs or with natural infection, cholesterol levels are reduced, indicating these viral miRNAs decrease cholesterol levels. A modified form of cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, is generated directly from cholesterol. Addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol to primary cells inhibited KSHV infection of cells, suggesting that viral miRNAs may decrease cholesterol levels to decrease the concentration of 25-hydroxycholesterol and to promote infection. These results suggest a new virus-host relationship and indicate a previously unidentified viral strategy to lower cholesterol levels.\n",

      "The incidence of human cervix adenocarcinoma (CC) caused by papillomavirus genome integration into the host chromosome is the third most common cancer among women. Bacterial cyclodipeptides (CDPs) exert cytotoxic effects in human cervical cancer HeLa cells, primarily by blocking the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, but downstream responses comprising gene expression remain unstudied. Seeking to understand the cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects of CDPs in HeLa cells, a global RNA-Seq analysis was performed. This strategy permitted the identification of 151 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were either up- or down-regulated in response to CDPs exposure. Database analysis, including Gene Ontology (COG), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), revealed differential gene expression on cancer transduction signals, and metabolic pathways, for which, expression profiles were modified by the CDPs exposure. Bioinformatics confirmed the impact of CDPs in the differential expression of genes from signal transduction pathways such as PI3K-Akt, mTOR, FoxO, Wnt, MAPK, P53, TGF-β, Notch, apoptosis, EMT, and CSC. Additionally, the CDPs exposure modified the expression of cancer-related transcription factors involved in the regulation of processes such as epigenetics, DNA splicing, and damage response. Interestingly, transcriptomic analysis revealed the participation of genes of the mevalonate and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways; in agreement with this observation, total cholesterol diminished, confirming the blockage of the cholesterol synthesis by the exposure of HeLa cells to CDPs. Interestingly, the expression of some genes of the mevalonate and cholesterol synthesis such as <i>HMGS1</i>, <i>HMGCR</i>, <i>IDI1</i>, <i>SQLE</i>, <i>MSMO1</i>, <i>SREBF1</i>, and <i>SOAT1</i> was up-regulated by CDPs exposure. Accordingly, metabolites of the mevalonate pathway were accumulated in cultures treated with CDPs. This finding further suggests that the metabolism of cholesterol is crucial for the occurrence of CC, and the blockade of the sterol synthesis as an anti-proliferative mechanism of the bacterial CDPs, represents a reasonable chemotherapeutic drug target to explore. Our transcriptomic study supports the anti-neoplastic effects of bacterial CDPs in HeLa cells shown previously, providing new insights into the transduction signals, transcription factors and metabolic pathways, such as mevalonate and cholesterol that are impacted by the CDPs and highlights its potential as anti-neoplastic drugs.\n",

      "In our study, the value of cholesterol biosynthesis is related to clinical analysis in 32 cancer forms in the GSEA database facility. We have a mutation between 25 CBRGs. In The Cancer Genome Atlas database, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC, <i>n</i> = 539) was upregulated or downregulated in 22 out of 25 cases (<i>n</i> = 72) compared with normal kidney tissue. Then, using LASSO regression analysis, the survival model that is based on nine risk-related CBRGs (<i>CYP51A1</i>, <i>HMGCR</i>, <i>HMGCS1</i>, <i>IDI1</i>, <i>FDFT1</i>, <i>SQLE</i>, <i>ACAT2</i>, <i>FDPS</i>, and <i>NSDHL</i>) is established. ROC curves confirmed the good omen of the new survival mode, and the area under the curve is 0.72 (5 years) and 0.709 (10 years). High <i>SQLE</i> and <i>ACAT2</i> expression and low <i>NSDHL</i>, <i>FDPS</i>, <i>CYP51A1</i>, <i>FDFT1</i>, <i>HMGCS1</i>, <i>HMGCR</i>, and <i>IDI1</i> expression were closely related to patients with high-risk renal clear cell carcinoma. Two types of Cox regression, uni- and multivariate, were used to determine risk scores, age, staging, and grade as independent risk factors for prognosis in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The results showed the prediction model established by 9 selected CBRGs could predict the prognosis more accurately.\n",

      "Cholesterol levels are an initiating risk factor for atherosclerosis. Many genes play a central role in cholesterol synthesis, including HMGCR, SQLE, HMGCS1, FDFT1, LSS, MVK, PMK, MVD, FDPS, CYP51, TM7SF2, LBR, MSMO1, NSDHL, HSD17B7, DHCR24, EBP, SC5D, DHCR7, IDI1/2. Especially, HMGCR, SQLE, FDFT1, LSS, FDPS, CYP51, and EBP are promising therapeutic targets for drug development due to many drugs have been approved and entered into clinical research by targeting these genes. However, new targets and drugs still need to be discovered. Interestingly, many small nucleic acid drugs and vaccines were approved for the market, including Inclisiran, Patisiran, Inotersen, Givosiran, Lumasiran, Nusinersen, Volanesorsen, Eteplirsen, Golodirsen, Viltolarsen, Casimersen, Elasomeran, Tozinameran. However, these agents are all linear RNA agents. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) may have longer half-lives, higher stability, lower immunogenicity, lower production costs, and higher delivery efficiency than these agents due to their covalently closed structures. CircRNA agents are developed by several companies, including Orna Therapeutics, Laronde, and CirCode, Therorna. Many studies have shown that circRNAs regulate cholesterol synthesis by regulating HMGCR, SQLE, HMGCS1, ACS, YWHAG, PTEN, DHCR24, SREBP-2, and PMK expression. MiRNAs are essential for circRNA-mediated cholesterol biosynthesis. Notable, the phase II trial for inhibiting miR-122 with nucleic acid drugs has been completed. Suppressing HMGCR, SQLE, and miR-122 with circRNA_ABCA1, circ-PRKCH, circEZH2, circRNA-SCAP, and circFOXO3 are the promising therapeutic target for drug development, specifically the circFOXO3. This review focuses on the role and mechanism of the circRNA/miRNA axis in cholesterol synthesis in the hope of providing knowledge to identify new targets.\n",

      "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the sixth-leading cause of death in industrialized countries. Neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques are one of the pathological hallmarks in AD patient brains. Aβ accumulates in the brain upon sequential, proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. However, so far disease-modifying drugs targeting β- and γ-secretase pathways seeking a decrease in the production of toxic Aβ peptides have failed in clinics. It has been demonstrated that the metalloproteinase meprin β acts as an alternative β-secretase, capable of generating truncated Aβ<sub>2-x</sub> peptides that have been described to be increased in AD patients. This indicates an important β-site cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1)-independent contribution of the metalloprotease meprin β within the amyloidogenic pathway and may lead to novel drug targeting avenues. However, meprin β itself is embedded in a complex regulatory network. Remarkably, the anti-amyloidogenic α-secretase a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) is a direct competitor for APP at the cell surface, but also a sheddase of inactive pro-meprin β. Overall, we highlight the current cellular, molecular and structural understanding of meprin β as alternative β-secretase within the complex protease web, regulating APP processing in health and disease.\n",

      "Engineered T cells represent an emerging therapeutic modality. However, complex engineering strategies can present a challenge for enriching and expanding therapeutic cells at clinical scale. In addition, lack of in vivo cytokine support can lead to poor engraftment of transferred T cells, including regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>). Here, we establish a cell-intrinsic selection system that leverages the dependency of primary T cells on IL-2 signaling. FRB-IL2RB and FKBP-IL2RG fusion proteins were identified permitting selective expansion of primary CD4+ T cells in rapamycin supplemented medium. This chemically inducible signaling complex (CISC) was subsequently incorporated into HDR donor templates designed to drive expression of the T<sub>reg</sub> master regulator FOXP3. Following editing of CD4+ T cells, CISC+ engineered T<sub>reg</sub> (CISC EngTreg) were selectively expanded using rapamycin and maintained T<sub>reg</sub> activity. Following transfer into immunodeficient mice treated with rapamycin, CISC EngTreg exhibited sustained engraftment in the absence of IL-2. Furthermore, in vivo CISC engagement increased the therapeutic activity of CISC EngTreg. Finally, an editing strategy targeting the TRAC locus permitted generation and selective enrichment of CISC+ functional CD19-CAR-T cells. Together, CISC provides a robust platform to achieve both in vitro enrichment and in vivo engraftment and activation, features likely beneficial across multiple gene-edited T cell applications.\n",

      "Bile salts play a pivotal role in lipid homeostasis, are sensed by specialized receptors, and have been implicated in various disorders affecting the gut or liver. They may play a role either as culprit or as potential panacea. Four very efficient transporters mediate most of the hepatic and intestinal bile salt uptake and efflux, and are each essential for the efficient enterohepatic circulation of bile salts. Starting from the intestinal lumen, conjugated bile salts cross the otherwise impermeable lipid bilayer of (primarily terminal ileal) enterocytes through the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (gene SLC10A2) and leave the enterocyte through the basolateral heteromeric organic solute transporter, which consists of an alpha and beta subunit (encoded by SLC51A and SLC51B). The Na<sup>+</sup> -taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (gene SLC10A1) efficiently clears the portal circulation of bile salts, and the apical bile salt export pump (gene ABCB11) pumps the bile salts out of the hepatocyte into primary bile, against a very steep concentration gradient. Recently, individuals lacking either functional Na<sup>+</sup> -taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide or organic solute transporter have been described, completing the quartet of bile acid transport deficiencies, as apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and bile salt export pump deficiencies were already known for years. Novel pathophysiological insights have been obtained from knockout mice lacking functional expression of these genes and from pharmacological transporter inhibition in mice or humans. Conclusion: We provide a concise overview of the four main bile salt transport pathways and of their status as possible targets of interventions in cholestatic or metabolic disorders.\n",

      "The yellow fever vaccine (YF17DD) is highly effective with a single injection conferring protection for at least 10 years. The YF17DD induces polyvalent responses, with a TH1/TH2 CD4<sup>+</sup> profile, robust T CD8<sup>+</sup> responses, and synthesis of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), culminating in high titers of neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, C-type lectin domain containing 5A (CLEC5A) has been implicated in innate outcomes in other flaviviral infections. Here, we conducted a follow-up study in volunteers immunized with YF17DD, investigating the humoral response, cellular phenotypes, gene expression, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IFNG and CLEC5A, to clarify the role of these factors in early response after vaccination. Activation of CLEC5A<sup>+</sup> monocytes occurred five days after vaccination (DAV). Following, seven DAV data showed activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells together with early positive correlations between type II IFN and genes of innate antiviral response (STAT1, STAT2, IRF7, IRF9, OAS1, and RNASEL) as well as antibody levels. Furthermore, individuals with genotypes rs2430561 AT/AA, rs2069718 AG/AA (IFNG), and rs13237944 AC/AA (CLEC5A), exhibited higher expression of IFNG and CLEC5A, respectively. Together, we demonstrated that early IFN-γ and CLEC5A responses, associated with rs2430561, rs2069718, and rs13237944 genotypes, may be key mechanisms in the long-lasting immunity elicited by YF17DD.\n",

      "The neurocristopathies encompass a spectrum of developmental disorders characterized by abnormalities of neural crest-derived structures. Neural crest cells are pluripotent progenitors and the mechanisms by which specific cell-fate decisions are regulated have emerged as an important field of study. Many neurocristopathies are characterized by defects in melanocyte differentiation that can result in pigmentation abnormalities and deafness. One example is Waardenburg syndrome that can be caused by mutations in the PAX3, SOX10 or MITF genes. Other neural crest-related disorders are associated with enteric ganglia defects, such as those caused by mutations in the SOX10 or c-RET genes. The Pax3 and Sox10 transcription factors can directly regulate both MITF and c-RET. Here, we show that Pax3 and Sox10 can physically interact and we map the interaction domains. We show that this interaction contributes to Pax3 and Sox10 synergistic activation of a conserved c-RET enhancer and it explains why Sox10 mutants that cannot bind to DNA retain the ability to activate this enhancer in the presence of Pax3. However, in the context of the MITF gene, Pax3 and Sox10 must each bind independently to DNA in order to achieve synergy. This difference is consistent with the different structures of the c-RET and MITF enhancers, and the different mechanisms by which Pax3 binds to these enhancers. These observations explain the phenotype in the mild form of Yemenite deaf-blind syndrome caused by specific SOX10 mutations in the HMG box that abrogate DNA binding without disrupting association with Pax3.\n",

      "Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is an autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of 1 in 40 000 that manifests with sensorineural deafness and pigmentation defects. It is classified into four types depending on the presence or absence of additional symptoms. WS1 and WS3 are due to mutations in the PAX3 gene whereas some WS2 cases are associated with mutations in the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) gene. The WS4 phenotype can result from mutations in the endothelin-B receptor gene (EDNRB), in the gene for its ligand, endothelin-3 (EDN3), or in the SOX10 gene. PAX3 has been shown to regulate MITF gene expression. The recent implication of SOX10 in WS4 prompted us to test whether this transcription factor, known to cooperate in vitro with PAX3, is also able to regulate expression from the MITF promoter. Here we show that SOX10, in synergy with PAX3, strongly activates MITF expression in transfection assays. Analyses revealed that PAX3 and SOX10 interact directly by binding to a proximal region of the MITF promoter containing binding sites for both factors. Moreover, SOX10 or PAX3 mutant proteins fail to transactivate this promoter, providing further evidence that the two genes act in concert to directly regulate expression of MITF. In situ hybridization experiments carried out in the dominant megacolon (DOM:) mouse, confirmed that SOX10 dysfunction impairs MITF: expression as well as melanocytic development and survival. These experiments, which demonstrate an interaction between three of the genes that are altered in WS, could explain the auditory-pigmentary symptoms of this disease.\n",

      "The transcription factors Pax3 and Zic1 are critical to specify the neural plate border and to promote neural crest formation. In a microarray screen designed to identify genes regulated by Pax3 and Zic1 in Xenopus we isolated Znf703/Nlz1 a transcriptional repressor member of the NET (NocA/Nlz, Elbow, and TLP-1) protein family. At early neurula stage znf703 is expressed in the dorsal ectoderm, spanning the neural plate and neural plate border, with an anterior boundary of expression corresponding to rhombomeres 3 and 4 (r3/r4) in the prospective hindbrain. As a bonafide target of Pax3 and Zic1, znf703 is activated by neural plate border inducing signals, and its expression depends on Pax3 and Zic1 function in the embryo. Znf703 morpholino-mediated knockdown expanded several posterior hindbrain genes, while Znf703 overexpression completely obliterated the expression of these segmental genes, signifying that the transcriptional repressor activity of Znf703 is critical to pattern the hindbrain. Furthermore, snai2 and sox10 expression was severely impaired upon manipulation of Znf703 expression levels in the embryo suggesting that Znf703 participates in neural crest formation downstream of Pax3 and Zic1 in Xenopus.\n",

      "Through a combination of in silico research and reviews of previous work, mechanisms by which nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) affects the inheritance and expressivity of Waardenburg syndrome is realized. While expressivity and inheritance both relate to biochemical processes underlying a gene's function, this research explores how alternative splicing and premature termination codons (PTC's) within mRNAs mutated in the disease are either translated into deleterious proteins or decayed to minimize expression of altered proteins. Elucidation of splice variants coupled with NMD perpetuating the various symptoms and inheritance patterns of this disease represent novel findings. By investigating nonsense mutations that lie within and outside the NMD boundary of these transcripts we can evaluate the effects of protein truncation versus minimized protein expression on the variable expressivity found between Type I and Type III Waardenburg syndrome, <i>PAX3,</i> while comparatively evaluating <i>EDN3</i> and <i>SOX10's</i> role in inheritance of Type IV subtypes of the disease. This review will demonstrate how alternative splicing perpetuates or limits NMD activity by way of PTC positioning, thereby affecting the presentation of Waardenburg syndrome.\n",

      "Melanoma is a cancer with a poorly understood molecular pathobiology. We find the transcription factors PAX3, SOX10, MITF, and the tyrosine kinase receptor MET expressed in melanoma cell lines and primary tumors. Analysis for MET expression in primary tumor specimens showed 27/40 (68%) of the samples displayed an increased expression of MET, and this expression was highly correlated with parallel expression of PAX3, SOX10, and MITF. PAX3 and MITF bind to elements in the MET promoter independently, without evidence of either synergistic activation or inhibition. SOX10 does not directly activate the MET gene alone, but can synergistically activate MET expression with either PAX3 or MITF. In melanoma cells, there was evidence of two pathways for PAX3 mediated MET induction: (i) direct activation of the gene, and (ii) indirect regulation through MITF. SK-MEL23 melanoma cells have both of these pathways intact, while SK-MEL28 melanoma cells only have the first pathway. In summary, we find that PAX3, SOX10 and MITF play an active role in melanoma cells by regulating the MET gene. In consequence, MET promotes the melanoma cancer phenotype by promoting migration, invasion, resistance to apoptosis, and tumor cell growth.\n",

      "The bulge region of the adult hair follicle contains the niches for both epithelial and melanocyte stem cells. Recent evidence suggests that the development of melanocyte stem cells is controlled by a complex network of transcription factors, including Pax3, Sox10, and Mitf, and of regulatory extracellular cues such as Wnt. However, additional players are likely to be involved. It will be intriguing to identify these signals and to elucidate whether and how neighboring epithelial stem cells influence the balance between melanocyte stem cell maintenance and differentiation.\n",

      "Neural crest cells generate numerous derivatives, including pigment cells, and are a model for studying how fate specification from multipotent progenitors is controlled. In mammals, the core gene regulatory network for melanocytes (their only pigment cell type) contains three transcription factors, Sox10, Pax3 and Mitf, with the latter considered a master regulator of melanocyte development. In teleosts, which have three to four pigment cell types (melanophores, iridophores and xanthophores, plus leucophores e.g. in medaka), gene regulatory networks governing fate specification are poorly understood, although Mitf function is considered conserved. Here, we show that the regulatory relationships between Sox10, Pax3 and Mitf are conserved in zebrafish, but the role for Mitf is more complex than previously emphasized, affecting xanthophore development too. Similarly, medaka Mitf is necessary for melanophore, xanthophore and leucophore formation. Furthermore, expression patterns and mutant phenotypes of pax3 and pax7 suggest that Pax3 and Pax7 act sequentially, activating mitf expression. Pax7 modulates Mitf function, driving co-expressing cells to differentiate as xanthophores and leucophores rather than melanophores. We propose that pigment cell fate specification should be considered to result from the combinatorial activity of Mitf with other transcription factors.\n",

      "The neural crest is a multipotent population of cells that originates a variety of cell types. Many animal models are used to study neural crest induction, migration and differentiation, with amphibians and birds being the most widely used systems. A major technological advance to study neural crest development in mouse, chick and zebrafish has been the generation of transgenic animals in which neural crest specific enhancers/promoters drive the expression of either fluorescent proteins for use as lineage tracers, or modified genes for use in functional studies. Unfortunately, no such transgenic animals currently exist for the amphibians Xenopus laevis and tropicalis, key model systems for studying neural crest development. Here we describe the generation and characterization of two transgenic Xenopus laevis lines, Pax3-GFP and Sox10-GFP, in which GFP is expressed in the pre-migratory and migratory neural crest, respectively. We show that Pax3-GFP could be a powerful tool to study neural crest induction, whereas Sox10-GFP could be used in the study of neural crest migration in living embryos.\n",

      "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a serious cardiovascular medical emergency that can lead to death. Necroptosis, a programmed cell death pathway, has been implicated in the development and progression of AMI. The aim of our study was to identify necroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (NRDEGs) in AMI and investigate their interactions and functions. The GSE66360 dataset was screened for NRDEGs using the 'limma' R package, with a threshold of p 0.05. A set of 159 necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) was retrieved from the KEGG database. The protein-protein interactions (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING data resource. Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) and cytohHubba plugin was applied to find the major modules and genes. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses were performed using the R 'clusterProfiler' package. The enrichment scores for immune cell types and associated biological pathways or functions were gained using the ssGSEA method. Our study identified 5 down-regulated and 16 up-regulated NRDEGs in AMI. The PPI network analysis revealed several important modules and hub genes, including TNF, IL1B, TLR4, STAT3, NLRP3, TNFAIP3, CYBB, IFNGR1, FADD, and IL33. GO analysis revealed that NRDEGs were enriched in multiple biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions, including those related to cytokine production, response to cytokine stimulus, and necroptotic process. NRDEGs were found to be particularly abundant in a number of non-disease pathways, such as necroptosis and immune-related pathways like cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and TNF signaling pathway, according to KEGG pathway analysis. The ssGSEA analysis revealed a correlation between immune cells and NRDEGs in AMI. The study identified NRDEGs and their interactions in AMI, providing insights into the potential function of necroptosis in the pathological process of AMI. The results imply that immune-related pathways and cytokines may be crucial in the initiation and development of AMI. The study provides a foundation for further research on the underlying mechanisms of necroptosis in AMI and the potential for developing novel therapies.\n",

      "Ischemic stroke (IS) is a leading cause of disability, morbidity, and mortality globally. Aging affects immune function and contributes to poor outcomes of IS in elderly individuals. However, little is known about how aging-related genes (ARGs) are involved in IS. In this study, the relationship between ARGs and IS immune microenvironment biomarkers was explored by bioinformatics. Two IS microarray datasets (GSE22255, GSE16561) from human blood samples were analyzed and 502 ARGs were identified, from which 29 differentially expressed ARGs were selected. Functional analysis revealed that 7 of these ARGs (<i>IL1B, FOS, JUN, CXCL5, PTGS2, TNFAIP3</i> and <i>TLR4</i>) were involved in five top enriched pathways (IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Rheumatoid arthritis, NF-kappa B signaling pathway and Pertussis) related to immune responses and inflammation. Five hub DE-ARGs (<i>IL2RB, FOS, IL7R, ALDH2</i> and <i>BIRC2</i>) were identified using machine learning algorithms, and their association with immune-related characteristics was confirmed by additional tests. Single-cell sequencing dataset GSE129788 was retrieved to analyze aging molecular-related features, which was in accordance with microarray datasets. Clustering analysis revealed two subtypes of IS, which were distinguished by their differential expression of genes related to the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. These findings highlight the importance of ARGs in regulating immune responses in IS and suggest potential prevention and treatment strategies as well as guidelines for future research.\n",

      "Vitamin A (retinol), in the biologically active form of retinoic acid (RA), has been proposed as involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We hypothesized that genetic basis of genes encoding RA metabolism enzymes, which control the cellular RA level, might be associated with this disease. This cascade genetic association model, using markers in genes of synthesis and degradation enzymes within the retinoid cascade, would better fit the biological character of the retinoid hypothesis than the single gene strategy. In the present study we chose to investigate 7 genes involved in the synthesis, degradation and transportation of RA, ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, CYP26A1, CYP26B1, CYP26C1 and Transthyretin (TTR), for their roles in the development of schizophrenia. We genotyped 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the regulatory and coding regions of these 7 genes using LDR technology in the 617 Chinese Han subjects. Case-control analyses were performed to detect association of these 7 genes with schizophrenia. Association analyses using both allelic and genotypic single-locus tests revealed no significant association between the risk for each of investigated gene and schizophrenia. However, analyses of multiple-locus haplotypes indicated that the overall frequency of rs4646642-rs4646580 of ALDH1A2 gene showed significant difference between patients and control subjects (p=0.0055). We also employed multifactor dimensionality reduction method to detect multilocus effects. In summary, in this work we show multiple candidate genes involved in retinoid cascade in schizophrenics. In addition, our results suggest a positive association between ALDH1A2 and schizophrenics in the Chinese population and support the retinoid hypothesis of schizophrenia.\n",

      "Fugu (Takifugu rubripes) has contributed as an ideal model organism for understanding the structure and evolution of vertebrate genomes, but also has potential as a good model organism for developmental biology because of the availability of the genome information. However, there is no comprehensive report describing the developmental stages, which is fundamental data for developmental biology. Here we describe a series of stages of the embryonic development of fugu during the first 8 days after fertilization, i.e. from fertilization to hatching. We define seven periods of embryogenesis - the zygote, cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, pharyngula, and hatching periods. Stages subdividing these periods are defined based on morphological characteristics. In addition, as a model experiment of gene expression analysis using this staging series, we performed in situ hybridization of aldh1a2, aldh1a3 and cyp26a1 that play regulatory roles in retinoic acid (RA) metabolism essential for embryogenesis. This report provides fundamental information on fugu embryogenesis, which is anticipated to facilitate the use of fugu as a model organism for developmental studies.\n",

      "Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) oxidize aldehydes to the corresponding carboxylic acids using either NAD or NADP as a coenzyme. Aldehydes are highly reactive aliphatic or aromatic molecules that play an important role in numerous physiological, pathological, and pharmacological processes. ALDHs have been discovered in practically all organisms and there are multiple isoforms, with multiple subcellular localizations. More than 160 ALDH cDNAs or genes have been isolated and sequenced to date from various sources, including bacteria, yeast, fungi, plants, and animals. The eukaryote ALDH genes can be subdivided into several families; the human genome contains 19 known ALDH genes, as well as many pseudogenes. Noteworthy is the fact that elevated activity of various ALDHs, namely ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, ALDH1A7, ALDH2*2, ALDH3A1, ALDH4A1, ALDH5A1, ALDH6, and ALDH9A1, has been observed in normal and cancer stem cells. Consequently, ALDHs not only may be considered markers of these cells, but also may well play a functional role in terms of self-protection, differentiation, and/or expansion of stem cell populations. The ALDH3 family includes enzymes able to oxidize medium-chain aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes, such as peroxidic and fatty aldehydes. Moreover, these enzymes also have noncatalytic functions, including antioxidant functions and some structural roles. The gene of the cytosolic form, ALDH3A1, is localized on chromosome 17 in human beings and on the 11th and 10th chromosome in the mouse and rat, respectively. ALDH3A1 belongs to the phase II group of drug-metabolizing enzymes and is highly expressed in the stomach, lung, keratinocytes, and cornea, but poorly, if at all, in normal liver. Cytosolic ALDH3 is induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or chlorinated compounds, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, in rat liver cells and increases during carcinogenesis. It has been observed that this increased activity is directly correlated with the degree of deviation in hepatoma and lung cancer cell lines, as is the case in chemically induced hepatoma in rats. High ALDH3A1 expression and activity have been correlated with cell proliferation, resistance against aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation, and resistance against drug toxicity, such as oxazaphosphorines. Indeed, cells with a high ALDH3A1 content are more resistant to the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of lipidic aldehydes than are those with a low content. A reduction in cell proliferation can be observed when the enzyme is directly inhibited by the administration of synthetic specific inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotides, or siRNA or indirectly inhibited by the induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) with polyunsaturated fatty acids or PPARγ transfection. Conversely, cell proliferation is stimulated by the activation of ALDH3A1, whether by inhibiting PPARγ with a specific antagonist, antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA, or a medical device (i.e., composite polypropylene prosthesis for hernia repair) used to induce cell proliferation. To date, the mechanisms underlying the effects of ALDHs on cell proliferation are not yet fully clear. A likely hypothesis is that the regulatory effect is mediated by the catabolism of some endogenous substrates deriving from normal cell metabolism, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, which have the capacity to either stimulate or inhibit the expression of genes involved in regulating proliferation.\n",

      "Colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic cancer are two very significant contributors to cancer-related deaths. Chronic alcohol consumption is an important risk factor for these cancers. Ethanol is oxidized primarily by alcohol dehydrogenases to acetaldehyde, an agent capable of initiating tumors by forming adducts with proteins and DNA. Acetaldehyde is metabolized by ALDH2, ALDH1B1, and ALDH1A1 to acetate. Retinoic acid (RA) is required for cellular differentiation and is known to arrest tumor development. RA is synthesized from retinaldehyde by the retinaldehyde dehydrogenases, specifically ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, and ALDH8A1. By eliminating acetaldehyde and generating RA, ALDHs can play a crucial regulatory role in the initiation and progression of cancers. ALDH1 catalytic activity has been used as a biomarker to identify and isolate normal and cancer stem cells; its presence in a tumor is associated with poor prognosis in colon and pancreatic cancer. In summary, these ALDHs are not only biomarkers for CRC and pancreatic cancer but also play important mechanistic role in cancer initiation, progression, and eventual prognosis.\n",

      "Retinoids, which include vitamin A (retinol) and metabolites such as retinoic acid, can inhibit tumor growth and reverse carcinogenesis in animal models of prostate cancer. We analyzed retinoid signaling and metabolism in the TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate) model. We detected increased retinol and retinyl esters in prostates pooled from 24 to 36 week TRAMP transgenic positive mice compared to nontransgenic littermates by HPLC. We used quantitative RT-PCR to measure transcripts for genes involved in retinoid signaling and metabolism, including ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, CYP26A1, LRAT, and RARbeta(2), in prostate tissue from TRAMP positive (+) and age-matched littermate control mice ranging from 18 to 36 weeks. Transcript levels of ALDH1A1, a putative stem cell marker, were decreased in ventral and lateral lobes of prostates from TRAMP mice compared to age-matched, nontransgenic mice. ALDH1A2 (RALDH2) mRNA levels in dorsal and anterior lobes of TRAMP+ mice were lower than in age-matched (24 week) nontransgenic mice. We detected lower RARbeta(2) mRNA levels in dorsal prostate lobes of 36 week TRAMP mice relative to nontransgenic mice. We detected high levels of ALDH1A2 protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus in nontransgenic murine prostate paraffin sections, and lower ALDH1A2 protein levels in all prostate lobes of TRAMP mice compared to nontransgenic mice by immunohistochemistry. We also detected much lower cytoplasmic ALDH1A2 protein levels in all human prostate cancer paraffin sections stained (19 total) relative to normal human prostate tissue on the same sections. Our data indicate that this reduction in ALDH1A2 protein is an early event in human prostate cancer.\n",

      "The successful targeting of neuroblastoma (NB) by associating tumor-initiating cells (TICs) is a major challenge in the development of new therapeutic strategies. The subfamily of aldehyde dehydrogenases 1 (ALDH1) isoenzymes, which comprises ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3, is involved in the synthesis of retinoic acid, and has been identified as functional stem cell markers in diverse cancers. By combining serial neurosphere passages with gene expression profiling, we have previously identified ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3 as potential NB TICs markers in patient-derived xenograft tumors. In this study, we explored the involvement of ALDH1 isoenzymes and the related ALDH activity in NB aggressive properties.\n",
      "ALDH activity and ALDH1A1/A2/A3 expression levels were measured using the ALDEFLUOR™ kit, and by real-time PCR, respectively. ALDH activity was inhibited using the specific ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), and ALDH1A3 gene knock-out was generated through the CRISPR/Cas9 technology.\n",
      "We first confirmed the enrichment of ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3 mRNA expression in NB cell lines and patient-derived xenograft tumors during neurosphere passages. We found that high ALDH1A1 expression was associated with less aggressive NB tumors and cell lines, and correlated with favorable prognostic factors. In contrast, we observed that ALDH1A3 was more widely expressed in NB cell lines and was associated with poor survival and high-risk prognostic factors. We also identified an important ALDH activity in various NB cell lines and patient-derived xenograft tumors. Specific inhibition of ALDH activity with diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) resulted in a strong reduction of NB cell clonogenicity, and TIC self-renewal potential, and partially enhanced NB cells sensitivity to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide. Finally, the specific knock-out of ALDH1A3 via CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing reduced NB cell clonogenicity, and mediated a cell type-dependent inhibition of TIC self-renewal properties.\n",
      "Together our data uncover the participation of ALDH enzymatic activity in the aggressive properties and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide resistance of NB, and show that the specific ALDH1A3 isoenzyme increases the aggressive capacities of a subset of NB cells.\n",

      "Evidence is presented for six opossum ALDH1A genes, including four ALDH1A1-like genes on chromosome 6 and ALDH1A2- and ALDH1A3-like genes on chromosome 1. Predicted structures for the opossum aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) subunits and the intron-exon boundaries for opossum ALDH genes showed a high degree of similarity with other mammalian ALDHs. Phylogenetic analyses supported the proposed designation of these opossum class 1 ALDHs as ALDH1A-like, ALDH1A2-like, and ALDH1A3-like and are therefore likely to play important roles in retinal and peroxidic aldehyde metabolism. Alignments of predicted opossum ALDH1A amino acid sequences with sheep ALDH1A1 and rat ALDH1A2 sequences demonstrated conservation of key residues previously shown to participate in catalysis and coenzyme binding. Amino acid substitution rates observed for family 1A ALDHs during vertebrate evolution indicated that ALDH1A2-like genes are evolving slower than ALDH1A1- and ALDH1A3-like genes. It is proposed that the common ancestor for ALDH1A genes predates the appearance of birds during vertebrate evolution.\n",

During eye development, the optic vesicles and later the retina generate RA as a metabolite of vitamin A (retinol). Retinol is first converted to retinaldehyde by retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10) and then to RA by all three retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3). In early mouse embryos, RA diffuses to tissues throughout the optic placode, optic vesicle, and adjacent mesenchyme to stimulate folding of the optic vesicle to form the optic cup. RA later generated by the retina is needed for further morphogenesis of the optic cup and surrounding perioptic mesenchyme; loss of RA at this stage leads to microphthalmia and cornea plus eyelid defects. RA functions by binding to nuclear RARs at RA response elements (RAREs) that either activate or repress transcription of key genes. Binding of RA to RARs regulates recruitment of transcriptional coregulators such as nuclear receptor coactivator (NCOA) or nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR), which in turn control binding of the generic coactivator p300 or the generic corepressor PRC2. No genes have been identified as direct targets of RA signaling during eye development, so future studies need to focus on identifying such genes and their RAREs. Studies designed to learn how RA normally controls eye development in vivo will provide basic knowledge valuable for determining how developmental eye defects occur and for improving strategies to treat eye defects.\n",

      "Retinoic acid has long been known to alter skin and hair growth but an exact mechanism is unclear. This study was performed to examine the sites of endogenous retinoic acid synthesis in the cycling hair follicle to better understand the role retinoic acid plays in this process. Retinal dehydrogenases (Aldh1a1, 2, and 3, formerly Raldh 1, 2, and 3) are the enzymes responsible for the last step in retinoic acid synthesis. Immunohistochemistry was performed on adult C57BL/6J mouse skin sections with antibodies against Aldh1a2 and Aldh1a3. Aldh1a2 expression was seen primarily in the outer root sheath and basal/spinous layer during all stages of the hair cycle, and in the bulge during anagen and early catagen, whereas Aldh1a3 expression was primarily in the dermal papilla, pre-cortex, and hair shaft during mid-late anagen. The expression patterns of these two similar retinoic acid synthesizing enzymes at specific follicular sites suggest that they mediate and are regulated by different epithelial proliferation and differentiation signaling pathways.\n",

      "High aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH<sup>hi</sup>) activity has been reported in normal and cancer stem cells. We and others have shown previously that human ALDH<sup>hi</sup> cardiac atrial appendage cells are enriched with stem/progenitor cells. The role of ALDH in these cells is poorly understood but it may come down to the specific ALDH isoform(s) expressed. This study aimed to compare ALDH<sup>hi</sup> and ALDH<sup>lo</sup> atrial cells and to identify the isoform(s) that contribute to ALDH activity, and their functional role. <b>Methods and Results:</b> Cells were isolated from atrial appendage specimens from patients with ischemic and/or valvular heart disease undergoing heart surgery. ALDH<sup>hi</sup> activity assessed with the Aldefluor reagent coincided with primitive surface marker expression (CD34<sup>+</sup>). Depending on their ALDH activity, RT-PCR analysis of ALDH<sup>hi</sup> and ALDH<sup>lo</sup> cells demonstrated a differential pattern of pluripotency genes (Oct 4, Nanog) and genes for more established cardiac lineages (Nkx2.5, Tbx5, Mef2c, GATA4). ALDH<sup>hi</sup> cells, but not ALDH<sup>lo</sup> cells, formed clones and were culture-expanded. When cultured under cardiac differentiation conditions, ALDH<sup>hi</sup> cells gave rise to a higher number of cardiomyocytes compared with ALDH<sup>lo</sup> cells. Among 19 ALDH isoforms known in human, ALDH1A3 was most highly expressed in ALDH<sup>hi</sup> atrial cells. Knocking down ALDH1A3, but not ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH2, ALDH4A1, or ALDH8A1 using siRNA decreased ALDH activity and cell proliferation in ALDH<sup>hi</sup> cells. Conversely, overexpressing ALDH1A3 with a retroviral vector increased proliferation in ALDH<sup>lo</sup> cells. <b>Conclusions:</b> ALDH1A3 is the key isoform responsible for ALDH activity in ALDH<sup>hi</sup> atrial appendage cells, which have a propensity to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. ALDH1A3 affects <i>in vitro</i> proliferation of these cells.\n",

      "Mammalian spermatogenesis involves highly regulated temporal and spatial dynamics, carefully controlled by several signalling processes. Retinoic acid (RA) signalling could have a critical role in spermatogenesis by promoting spermatogonia differentiation, adhesion of germ cells to Sertoli cells, and release of mature spermatids. An optimal testicular RA concentration is maintained by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), which oxidize RA precursors to produce RA, whereas the CYP26 class of enzymes catabolizes (oxidize) RA into inactive metabolites. The objective was to elucidate gene expression of these RA-metabolizing enzymes (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, CYP26A1, CYP26B1 and CYP26C1) and their protein presence in testes of young, peripubertal and adult dogs. Genes encoding RA-synthesizing isozymes ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3 and RA-catabolizing isomers CYP26A1, CYP26B1 and CYP26C1 were expressed in testis at varying levels during testicular development from birth to adulthood in dogs. Based on detailed analyses of mRNA expression patterns, ALDH1A2 was regarded as a primary RA-synthesizing enzyme and CYP26B1 as a critical RA-hydrolysing enzyme; presumably, these genes have vital roles in maintaining RA homeostasis, which is imperative to spermatogenesis and other testicular functions in post-natal canine testis.\n",

      "Although there is a sizable amount of research focusing on adult neural progenitor cells (NPCs) as a therapeutic approach for many neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis, little is known about the pathways that govern NPC survival and apoptosis. Fas, a member of the death receptor superfamily, plays a well-characterized role in the immune system, but its function in neural stem cells remains uncertain. Our study focuses on the effects of Fas on NPC survival in vitro. Activation of Fas by recombinant Fas ligand (FasL) did not induce apoptosis in murine NPCs in culture. In fact, both an increase in the amount of viable cells and a decrease in apoptotic and dying cells were observed with FasL treatment. Our data indicate that FasL-mediated adult NPC neuroprotection is characterized by a reduction in apoptosis, but not increased proliferation. Further investigation of this effect revealed that the antiapoptotic effects of FasL are mediated by the up-regulation of Birc3, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP). Conversely, the observed effect is not the result of altered caspase activation or FLIP (Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitory protein) up-regulation, which is known to inhibit caspase-8-mediated cell death in T cells. Our data indicate that murine adult NPCs are resistant to FasL-induced cell death. Activation of Fas increased cell survival by decreasing apoptosis through Birc3 up-regulation. These results describe a novel pathway involved in NPC survival.\n",

      "The juxtaposition of a dense capillary network to lung epithelial cells is essential for air-blood gas exchange. Defective lung vascular development can result in bronchopulmonary dysplasia and alveolar capillary dysplasia. Although vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) is required for formation of the lung capillary network, little is known regarding the factors that regulate the density and location of the distal capillary plexus and the expression pattern of Vegfa. Here, we show that fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling to lung mesenchyme, but not to endothelial cells, are each necessary and together sufficient for distal capillary development. Furthermore, both gain- and loss-of-function of FGF9 regulates Vegfa expression in lung mesenchyme, and VEGF signaling is required for FGF9-mediated blood vessel formation. FGF9, however, can only partially rescue the reduction in capillary density found in the absence of SHH signaling, and SHH is unable to rescue the vascular phenotype found in Fgf9(-/-) lungs. Thus, both signaling systems regulate distinct aspects of vascular development in distal lung mesenchyme. These data suggest a molecular mechanism through which FGF9 and SHH signaling coordinately control the growth and patterning of the lung capillary plexus, and regulate the temporal and spatial expression of Vegfa.\n",
