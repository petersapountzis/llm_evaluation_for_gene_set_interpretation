      "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), glycoproteins secreted by some cells, are members of the TGF-β superfamily that have been implicated in a wide variety of roles. Currently, about 20 different BMPs have been identified and grouped into subfamilies, according to similarities with respect to their amino acid sequences. It has been shown that BMPs are secreted growth factors involved in mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, also being reported to control the differentiation of cancer stem cells. BMPs initiate signaling from the cell surface by binding to two different receptors (R: Type I and II). The heterodimeric formation of type I R and II R may occur before or after BMP binding, inducing signal transduction pathways through SMADs. BMPs may also signal through SMAD-independent pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK, p38MAPKs, JNK). BMPs may act in an autocrine or paracrine manner, being regulated by specific antagonists, namely: noggin and chordin. Genetic engineering allows the production of large amounts of BMPs for clinical use, and clinical trials have shown the benefits of FDA-approved recombinant human BMPs 2 and 7. Several materials from synthetic to natural sources have been tested as BMP carriers, ranging from hydroxyapatite, and organic polymers to collagen. Bioactive membranes doped with BMPs are promising options, acting to accelerate and enhance osteointegration. The development of smart materials, mainly based on biopolymers and bone-like calcium phosphates, appears to provide an attractive alternative for delivering BMPs in an adequately controlled fashion. BMPs have revealed a promising future for the fields of Bioengineering and Regenerative Medicine. In this chapter, we review and discuss the data on BMP structure, mechanisms of action, and possible clinical applications.\n",

      "The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and the growth and differentiation factors comprise a single family of some 20 homologous, dimeric cytokines which share the cystine-knot domain typical of the TGF-β superfamily. They control the differentiation and activity of a range of cell types, including many outside bone and cartilage. They serve as developmental morphogens, but are also important in chronic pathologies, including tissue fibrosis and cancer. One mechanism for enabling tight spatiotemporal control of their activities is through a number of antagonist proteins, including Noggin, Follistatin, Chordin, Twisted gastrulation (TSG), and the seven members of the Cerberus and Dan family. These antagonists are secreted proteins that bind selectively to particular BMPs with high affinity, thereby blocking receptor engagement and signaling. Most of these antagonists also possess a TGF-β cystine-knot domain. Here, we discuss current knowledge and understanding of the structures and activities of the BMPs and their antagonists, with a particular focus on the latter proteins. Recent advances in structural biology of BMP antagonists have begun the process of elucidating the molecular basis of their activity, displaying a surprising variety between the modes of action of these closely related proteins. We also discuss the interactions of the antagonists with the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate, which is found ubiquitously on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix.\n",

      "Today, cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) does not only play a major role in the course of development but also contributes to several cardiovascular diseases in adulthood. EndMT is characterized by down-regulation of the endothelial proteins and highly up-regulated fibrotic specific genes and extracellular matrix-forming proteins. EndMT is also a transforming growth factor- β-driven (TGF-β) process in which endothelial cells lose their endothelial characteristics and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype with expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibroblastspecific protein 1, etc. EndMT is a vital process during cardiac development, thus disrupted EndMT gives rise to the congenital heart diseases, namely septal defects and valve abnormalities. In this review, we have discussed the main signaling pathways and mechanisms participating in the process of EndMT such as TGF-β and Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Wnt#, and Notch signaling pathway and also studied the role of EndMT in physiological cardiovascular development and pathological conditions including myocardial infarction, pulmonary arterial hypertension, congenital heart defects, cardiac fibrosis, and atherosclerosis. As a perspective view, having a clear understanding of involving cellular and molecular mechanisms in EndMT and conducting Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a large number of samples for involving pharmacological agents may guide us into novel therapeutic approaches of congenital disorders and heart diseases.\n",

Genetic deficiency in distinct components of TGF-β and BMP-induced signalling pathways or their excessive activation has been reported to regulate the development and progression of some cancers. As more in-depth studies about this superfamily have been conducted, more evidence suggests that the TGF-β and BMP pathways play an opposing role. The cross-talk of these 2 pathways has been widely studied in kidney disease and bone formation, and the opposing effects have also been observed in some cancers. However, the antagonistic mechanisms are still insufficiently investigated in cancer. In this review, we aim to display more evidences and possible mechanisms accounting for the antagonism between these 2 pathways, which might provide some clues for further study in cancer.\n",

      "Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a driving force of renal fibrosis, which may lead to chronic kidney diseases and even end stage renal diseases. By activating canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways, TGF-β promotes the synthesis of extracellular matrix while preventing their degradation. In the injured kidney, TGF-β induces apoptosis, proliferation and fibrotic response of renal cells including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, podocytes, fibroblasts, pericytes and macrophages, and it also promotes transdifferentiation, activation and proliferation of myofibroblasts. Additionally, TGF-β exerts profibrotic effects by interplaying with other signaling pathways like BMP-7, Wnt/β-catenin and MAP kinase. Smad3 is the central pathological gene in renal fibrosis, and epigenetic regulation of TGF-β/Smad3 is a hot topic in kidney field. Although direct targeting TGF-β may cause side effects including tumorigenesis and immune diseases, the therapeutic strategies targeting the balance of downstream Smad3 and Smad7 may prevent or delay the progression of fibrotic kidney disease.\n",

      "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the TGF-β superfamily of signaling ligands which comprise a family of pluripotent cytokines regulating a multitude of cellular events. Although BMPs were originally discovered as potent factors extractable from bone matrix that are capable to induce ectopic bone formation in soft tissues, their mode of action has been mostly studied as soluble ligands in absence of the physiologically relevant cellular microenvironment. This micro milieu is defined by supramolecular networks of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that specifically target BMP ligands, present them to their cellular receptors, and allow their controlled release. Here we focus on functional interactions and mechanisms that were described to control BMP bioavailability in a spatio-temporal manner within the respective tissue context. Structural disturbance of the ECM architecture due to mutations in ECM proteins leads to dysregulated BMP signaling as underlying cause for connective tissue disease pathways. We will provide an overview about current mechanistic concepts of how aberrant BMP signaling drives connective tissue destruction in inherited and chronic diseases.\n",

      "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) plays a fundamental role in the regulation of bone organogenesis through the activation of receptor serine/threonine kinases. Perturbations of TGF-β/BMP activity are almost invariably linked to a wide variety of clinical outcomes, i.e., skeletal, extra skeletal anomalies, autoimmune, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Phosphorylation of TGF-β (I/II) or BMP receptors activates intracellular downstream Smads, the transducer of TGF-β/BMP signals. This signaling is modulated by various factors and pathways, including transcription factor Runx2. The signaling network in skeletal development and bone formation is overwhelmingly complex and highly time and space specific. Additive, positive, negative, or synergistic effects are observed when TGF-β/BMP interacts with the pathways of MAPK, Wnt, Hedgehog (Hh), Notch, Akt/mTOR, and miRNA to regulate the effects of BMP-induced signaling in bone dynamics. Accumulating evidence indicates that Runx2 is the key integrator, whereas Hh is a possible modulator, miRNAs are regulators, and β-catenin is a mediator/regulator within the extensive intracellular network. This review focuses on the activation of BMP signaling and interaction with other regulatory components and pathways highlighting the molecular mechanisms regarding TGF-β/BMP function and regulation that could allow understanding the complexity of bone tissue dynamics.\n",

      "Correct organization of the vascular tree requires the balanced activities of several signaling pathways that regulate tubulogenesis and vascular branching, elongation, and pruning. When this balance is lost, the vessels can be malformed and fragile, and they can lose arteriovenous differentiation. In this review, we concentrate on the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway, which is one of the most important and complex signaling systems in vascular development. Inactivation of these pathways can lead to altered vascular organization in the embryo. In addition, many vascular malformations are related to deregulation of TGF-β/BMP signaling. Here, we focus on two of the most studied vascular malformations that are induced by deregulation of TGF-β/BMP signaling: hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM). The first of these is related to loss-of-function mutation of the TGF-β/BMP receptor complex and the second to increased signaling sensitivity to TGF-β/BMP. In this review, we discuss the potential therapeutic targets against these vascular malformations identified so far, as well as their basis in general mechanisms of vascular development and stability.\n",

      "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling is involved in a vast majority of cellular processes and is fundamentally important throughout life. TGF-β/BMPs have widely recognized roles in bone formation during mammalian development and exhibit versatile regulatory functions in the body. Signaling transduction by TGF-β/BMPs is specifically through both canonical Smad-dependent pathways (TGF-β/BMP ligands, receptors and Smads) and non-canonical Smad-independent signaling pathway (e.g. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, MAPK). Following TGF-β/BMP induction, both the Smad and p38 MAPK pathways converge at the Runx2 gene to control mesenchymal precursor cell differentiation. The coordinated activity of Runx2 and TGF-β/BMP-activated Smads is critical for formation of the skeleton. Recent advances in molecular and genetic studies using gene targeting in mice enable a better understanding of TGF-β/BMP signaling in bone and in the signaling networks underlying osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. This review summarizes the recent advances in our understanding of TGF-β/BMP signaling in bone from studies of genetic mouse models and human diseases caused by the disruption of TGF-β/BMP signaling. This review also highlights the different modes of cross-talk between TGF-β/BMP signaling and the signaling pathways of MAPK, Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, and FGF in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation.\n",
