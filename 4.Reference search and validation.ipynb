      "Mitoribosomes perform the synthesis of the core components of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system encoded by the mitochondrial genome. We provide evidence that MrpL35 (mL38), a mitospecific component of the yeast mitoribosomal central protuberance, assembles into a subcomplex with MrpL7 (uL5), Mrp7 (bL27), and MrpL36 (bL31) and mitospecific proteins MrpL17 (mL46) and MrpL28 (mL40). We isolated respiratory defective <i>mrpL35</i> mutant yeast strains, which do not display an overall inhibition in mitochondrial protein synthesis but rather have a problem in cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase complex (COX) assembly. Our findings indicate that MrpL35, with its partner Mrp7, play a key role in coordinating the synthesis of the Cox1 subunit with its assembly into the COX enzyme and in a manner that involves the Cox14 and Coa3 proteins. We propose that MrpL35 and Mrp7 are regulatory subunits of the mitoribosome acting to coordinate protein synthesis and OXPHOS assembly events and thus the bioenergetic capacity of the mitochondria.\n",

      "Oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria requires the synthesis of proteins encoded in the mitochondrial DNA. The mitochondrial translation machinery differs significantly from that of the bacterial ancestor of the organelle. This is especially evident from many mitochondria-specific ribosomal proteins. An important site of the ribosome is the polypeptide tunnel exit. Here, nascent chains are exposed to an aqueous environment for the first time. Many biogenesis factors interact with the tunnel exit of pro- and eukaryotic ribosomes to help the newly synthesized proteins to mature. To date, nothing is known about the organization of the tunnel exit of mitochondrial ribosomes. We therefore undertook a comprehensive approach to determine the composition of the yeast mitochondrial ribosomal tunnel exit. Mitochondria contain homologues of the ribosomal proteins located at this site in bacterial ribosomes. Here, we identified proteins located in their proximity by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry. Our analysis revealed a complex network of interacting proteins including proteins and protein domains specific to mitochondrial ribosomes. This network includes Mba1, the membrane-bound ribosome receptor of the inner membrane, as well as Mrpl3, Mrpl13, and Mrpl27, which constitute ribosomal proteins exclusively found in mitochondria. This unique architecture of the tunnel exit is presumably an adaptation of the translation system to the specific requirements of the organelle.\n",

      "Mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (mrps) of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been extensively characterized genetically and biochemically. However, the list of the genes encoding individual mrps is still not complete and quite a few of the mrps are only predicted from their similarity to bacterial ribosomal proteins. We have constructed a yeast strain in which one of the small subunit proteins, termed Mrp4, was tagged with S-peptide and used for affinity purification of mitochondrial ribosome. Mass spectrometric analysis of the isolated proteins detected most of the small subunit mrps which were previously identified or predicted and about half of the large subunit mrps. In addition, several proteins of unknown function were identified. To confirm their identity further, we added tags to these proteins and analyzed their localization in subcellular fractions. Thus, we have newly established Ymr158w (MrpS8), Ypl013c (MrpS16), Ymr188c (MrpS17) and Ygr165w (MrpS35) as small subunit mrps and Img1, Img2, Ydr116c (MrpL1), Ynl177c (MrpL22), Ynr022c (MrpL50) and Ypr100w (MrpL51) as large subunit mrps.\n",

      "MRPL39 encodes one of 52 proteins comprising the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome). In conjunction with 30 proteins in the small subunit, the mitoribosome synthesizes the 13 subunits of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system encoded by mitochondrial Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). We used multi-omics and gene matching to identify three unrelated individuals with biallelic variants in MRPL39 presenting with multisystem diseases with severity ranging from lethal, infantile-onset (Leigh syndrome spectrum) to milder with survival into adulthood. Clinical exome sequencing of known disease genes failed to diagnose these patients; however quantitative proteomics identified a specific decrease in the abundance of large but not small mitoribosomal subunits in fibroblasts from the two patients with severe phenotype. Re-analysis of exome sequencing led to the identification of candidate single heterozygous variants in mitoribosomal genes MRPL39 (both patients) and MRPL15. Genome sequencing identified a shared deep intronic MRPL39 variant predicted to generate a cryptic exon, with transcriptomics and targeted studies providing further functional evidence for causation. The patient with the milder disease was homozygous for a missense variant identified through trio exome sequencing. Our study highlights the utility of quantitative proteomics in detecting protein signatures and in characterizing gene-disease associations in exome-unsolved patients. We describe Relative Complex Abundance analysis of proteomics data, a sensitive method that can identify defects in OXPHOS disorders to a similar or greater sensitivity to the traditional enzymology. Relative Complex Abundance has potential utility for functional validation or prioritization in many hundreds of inherited rare diseases where protein complex assembly is disrupted.\n",

      "Complexome profiling is a novel technique which uses shotgun proteomics to establish protein migration profiles from fractionated blue native electrophoresis gels. Here we present a dataset of blue native electrophoresis migration profiles for 953 proteins by complexome profiling. By analysis of mitochondrial ribosomal complexes we demonstrate its potential to verify putative protein-protein interactions identified by affinity purification-mass spectrometry studies. Protein complexes were extracted in their native state from a HEK293 mitochondrial fraction and separated by blue native gel electrophoresis. Gel lanes were cut into gel slices of even size and analyzed by shotgun proteomics. Subsequently, the acquired protein migration profiles were analyzed for co-migration via hierarchical cluster analysis. This dataset holds great promise as a comprehensive resource for de novo identification of protein-protein interactions or to underpin and prioritize candidate protein interactions from other studies. To demonstrate the potential use of our dataset we focussed on the mitochondrial translation machinery. Our results show that mitoribosomal complexes can be analyzed by blue native gel electrophoresis, as at least four distinct complexes. Analysis of these complexes confirmed that 24 proteins that had previously been reported to co-purify with mitoribosomes indeed co-migrated with subunits of the mitochondrial ribosome. Co-migration of several proteins involved in biogenesis of inner mitochondrial membrane complexes together with mitoribosomal complexes suggested the possibility of co-translational assembly in human cells. Our data also highlighted a putative ribonucleotide complex that potentially contains MRPL10, MRPL12 and MRPL53 together with LRPPRC and SLIRP.\n",

      "Mutations in nuclear-encoded protein subunits of the mitochondrial ribosome are an increasingly recognised cause of oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) disorders. Among them, mutations in the MRPL44 gene, encoding a structural protein of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, have been identified in four patients with OXPHOS defects and early-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with or without additional clinical features. A 23-year-old individual with cardiac and skeletal myopathy, neurological involvement, and combined deficiency of OXPHOS complexes in skeletal muscle was clinically and genetically investigated. Analysis of whole-exome sequencing data revealed a homozygous mutation in MRPL44 (c.467 T > G), which was not present in the biological father, and a region of homozygosity involving most of chromosome 2, raising the possibility of uniparental disomy. Short-tandem repeat and genome-wide SNP microarray analyses of the family trio confirmed complete maternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 2. Mitochondrial ribosome assembly and mitochondrial translation were assessed in patient derived-fibroblasts. These studies confirmed that c.467 T > G affects the stability or assembly of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, leading to impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis and decreased levels of multiple OXPHOS components. This study provides evidence of complete maternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 2 in a patient with MRPL44-related disease, and confirms that MRLP44 mutations cause a mitochondrial translation defect that may present as a multisystem disorder with neurological involvement.\n",

      "Mitochondrial ribosomal protein large 24 (MRPL24) is 1 of the 82 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes, playing an essential role in the mitochondrial translation process. We report here on a baby girl with cerebellar atrophy, choreoathetosis of limbs and face, intellectual disability and a combined defect of complexes I and IV in muscle biopsy, caused by a homozygous missense mutation identified in MRPL24. The variant predicts a Leu91Pro substitution at an evolutionarily conserved site. Using human mutant cells and the zebrafish model, we demonstrated the pathological role of the identified variant. In fact, in fibroblasts we observed a significant reduction of MRPL24 protein and of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and IV subunits, as well a markedly reduced synthesis of the mtDNA-encoded peptides. In zebrafish we demonstrated that the orthologue gene is expressed in metabolically active tissues, and that gene knockdown induced locomotion impairment, structural defects and low ATP production. The motor phenotype was complemented by human WT but not mutant cRNA. Moreover, sucrose density gradient fractionation showed perturbed assembly of large subunit mitoribosomal proteins, suggesting that the mutation leads to a conformational change in MRPL24, which is expected to cause an aberrant interaction of the protein with other components of the 39S mitoribosomal subunit.\n",

Nitrosoguanidine-induced K<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub>-resistant mutants were isolated, and one of these mutants, named Sc57-Te<sub>5</sub><sup>R</sup>, was characterized. Both random spore analysis and tetrad analysis and growth of heterozygous (Te<sup>S</sup>/Te<sub>5</sub><sup>R</sup>) diploid from Sc57-Te<sub>5</sub><sup>R</sup> mutant revealed that nuclear and recessive mutation(s) was responsible for the resistance. To get insight into the mechanisms responsible for K<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub>-resistance, RNA microarray analyses were performed with K<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub>-treated and untreated Sc57-Te<sub>5</sub><sup>R</sup> cells. A total of 372 differentially expressed loci were identified corresponding to 6.37% of the S. cerevisiae transcriptome. Of these, 288 transcripts were up-regulated upon K<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub> treatment. About half of up-regulated transcripts were associated with the following molecular functions: oxidoreductase activity, structural constituent of cell wall, transporter activity. Comparative whole-genome sequencing allowed us to identify nucleotide variants distinguishing Sc57-Te<sub>5</sub><sup>R</sup> from parental strain Sc57. We detected 15 CDS-inactivating mutations, and found that 3 of them affected genes coding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPL44 and NAM9) and mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis (GEP3) pointing out to alteration of mitochondrial ribosome as main determinant of tellurite resistance.\n",

      "Cardiac dysfunction is a common phenotypic manifestation of primary mitochondrial disease with multiple nuclear and mitochondrial DNA pathogenic variants as a cause, including disorders of mitochondrial translation. To date, five patients have been described with pathogenic variants in MRPL44, encoding the ml44 protein which is part of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome). Three presented as infants with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mild lactic acidosis, and easy fatigue and muscle weakness, whereas two presented in adolescence with myopathy and neurological symptoms. We describe two infants who presented with cardiomyopathy from the neonatal period, failure to thrive, hypoglycemia and in one infant lactic acidosis. A decompensation of the cardiac function in the first year resulted in demise. Exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous variants in the MRPL44 gene including the known pathogenic variant c.467 T > G and two novel pathogenic variants. We document a combined respiratory chain enzyme deficiency with emphasis on complex I and IV, affecting heart muscle tissue more than skeletal muscle or fibroblasts. We show this to be caused by reduced mitochondrial DNA encoded protein synthesis affecting all subunits, and resulting in dysfunction of complex I and IV assembly. The degree of oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction correlated with the impairment of mitochondrial protein synthesis due to different pathogenic variants. These functional studies allow for improved understanding of the pathogenesis of MRPL44-associated mitochondrial disorder.\n",

      "The complexes of the respiratory chain represent mosaics of nuclear and mitochondrially encoded components. The processes by which synthesis and assembly of the various subunits are coordinated remain largely elusive. During evolution, many proteins of the mitochondrial ribosome acquired additional domains pointing at specific properties or functions of the translation machinery in mitochondria. Here, we analyzed the function of Mrpl36, a protein associated with the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein, homologous to the ribosomal protein L31 from bacteria, contains a mitochondria-specific C-terminal domain that is not required for protein synthesis per se; however, its absence decreases stability of Mrpl36. Cells lacking this C-terminal domain can still synthesize proteins, but these translation products fail to be properly assembled into respiratory chain complexes and are rapidly degraded. Surprisingly, overexpression of Mrpl36 seems to even increase the efficiency of mitochondrial translation. Our data suggest that Mrpl36 plays a critical role during translation that determines the rate of respiratory chain assembly. This important function seems to be carried out by a stabilizing activity of Mrpl36 on the interaction between large and small ribosomal subunits, which could influence accuracy of protein synthesis.\n",

This protein was previously found in association with the mitochondrial ribosome of bovine liver extracts. However, the precise Mrpl44 localization had been unclear. Here, we show by immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation that Mrpl44 is localized to the matrix of the mitochondria. We found that it can form multimers, and confirm that it is part of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. By manipulating its expression, we show that Mrpl44 may be important for regulating the expression of mtDNA-encoded genes. This was at the level of RNA expression and protein translation. This ultimately impacted ATP synthesis capability and respiratory capacity of cells. These findings indicate that Mrpl44 plays an important role in the regulation of the mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity.\n",

      "Mitochondrial ribosome proteins (MRPs), which are encoded by the nuclear genomic DNA, are important for mitochondrial-encoded protein synthesis and mitochondrial function. Emerging evidence suggests that several MRPs also exhibit important extra-mitochondrial functions, such as involvement in apoptosis, protein biosynthesis, and signal transduction. In this study, we demonstrate a significant role of MRP L35 (MRPL35) in colorectal cancer (CRC). The expression of MRPL35 was higher in CRC tissues than in matched cancer-adjacent tissues and higher in CRC cells than in normal mucosal epithelial cells. Higher MRPL35 expression in CRC tissue correlated with shorter overall survival for CRC patients. In vitro, down-regulation of MRPL35 led to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) together with DNA damage, loss of cell proliferation, G<sub>2</sub>/M arrest, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis, and autophagy induction. MRPL35 knockdown inhibited tumor proliferation in a CRC xenograft nude mouse model. Furthermore, overexpression of MRPL35 or treatment of cells with the ROS scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine, abrogated ROS production, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in vitro. These findings suggest that MRPL35 plays an essential role in the development of CRC and may be a potential therapeutic target for CRC.\n",

      "Mitochondrial diseases are a group of genetic disorders characterized by dysfunctional mitochondria. Within eukaryotic cells, mitochondria contain their own ribosomes, which synthesize small amounts of proteins, all of which are essential for the biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation system. The ribosome is an evolutionarily conserved macromolecular machine in nature both from a structural and functional point of view, universally responsible for the synthesis of proteins. Among the diseases afflicting humans, those of ribosomal origin - either cytoplasmic ribosomes (80S) or mitochondrial ribosomes (70S) - are relevant. These are inherited or acquired diseases most commonly caused by either ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency or defects in ribosome biogenesis. Here we review the scientific literature about the recent advances on changes in mitochondrial ribosomal structural and assembly proteins that are implicated in primary mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, and their possible connection with metalloid pollution and toxicity, with a focus on MRPL44, NAM9 (MNA6) and GEP3 (MTG3), whose lack or defect was associated with resistance to tellurite. Finally, we illustrate the suitability of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as model organisms for studying mitochondrial ribosome dysfunctions including those involved in human diseases.\n",

      "A homozygous missense mutation (c.822G>C) was found in the gene encoding the mitochondrial asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (NARS2) in two siblings born to consanguineous parents. These siblings presented with different phenotypes: one had mild intellectual disability and epilepsy in childhood, whereas the other had severe myopathy. Biochemical analysis of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes in both siblings revealed a combined complex I and IV deficiency in skeletal muscle. In-gel activity staining after blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the decreased activity of complex I and IV, and, in addition, showed the presence of complex V subcomplexes. Considering the consanguineous descent, homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing were combined revealing the presence of one single missense mutation in the shared homozygous region. The c.822G>C variant affects the 3' splice site of exon 7, leading to skipping of the whole exon 7 and a part of exon 8 in the NARS2 mRNA. In EBV-transformed lymphoblasts, a specific decrease in the amount of charged mt-tRNA(Asn) was demonstrated as compared with controls. This confirmed the pathogenic nature of the variant. To conclude, the reported variant in NARS2 results in a combined OXPHOS complex deficiency involving complex I and IV, making NARS2 a new member of disease-associated aaRS2.\n",

      "By way of whole-exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous missense mutation in VARS2 in one subject with microcephaly and epilepsy associated with isolated deficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complex I and compound heterozygous mutations in TARS2 in two siblings presenting with axial hypotonia and severe psychomotor delay associated with multiple MRC defects. The nucleotide variants segregated within the families, were absent in Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) databases and are predicted to be deleterious. The amount of VARS2 and TARS2 proteins and valyl-tRNA and threonyl-tRNA levels were decreased in samples of afflicted patients according to the genetic defect. Expression of the corresponding wild-type transcripts in immortalized mutant fibroblasts rescued the biochemical impairment of mitochondrial respiration and yeast modeling of the VARS2 mutation confirmed its pathogenic role. Taken together, these data demonstrate the role of the identified mutations for these mitochondriopathies. Our study reports the first mutations in the VARS2 and TARS2 genes, which encode two mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, as causes of clinically distinct, early-onset mitochondrial encephalopathies.\n",
