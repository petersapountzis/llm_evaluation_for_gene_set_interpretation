It has no known ligand and typically heterodimerizes with other family members, such as ERBB3 and ERBB4, to initiate signaling cascades. ERBB2 is involved in the regulation of cell growth, survival, and differentiation and is often overexpressed in certain types of breast cancer.

2. ERBB4 (also known as HER4) is another member of the EGFR family and can form homodimers or heterodimers with other family members, including ERBB2.

It also interacts with AKT1, which can influence its stability and localization.

3. EGF is a growth factor that stimulates cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation by binding to its receptor, EGFR. This binding leads to receptor dimerization and activation, initiating a cascade of downstream signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt pathway.

4. EGFR is the cell surface receptor for members of the epidermal growth factor family (EGF family) of extracellular protein ligands. Upon EGF binding, EGFR undergoes dimerization and internal autophosphorylation, leading to activation of several intracellular signaling cascades, including the PI3K/Akt pathway, which promotes cell survival and proliferation.

5. NF2, also known as Merlin, functions as a tumor suppressor. It is involved in the contact inhibition signaling pathway and negatively regulates cell growth and proliferation. NF2 can interact with components of the PI3K/Akt pathway, influencing its activity and contributing to the regulation of cell survival and proliferation.

6. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a phosphatase that antagonizes the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), the product of PI3K. This action effectively downregulates AKT1 activity, leading to the suppression of cell growth and survival signals.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are heavily involved in the regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is a central pathway influencing cell survival, growth, and proliferation. The interactions between these proteins modulate the pathway's activity, with AKT1, EGF, and EGFR promoting activation, while NF2 and PTEN serve as negative regulators, ensuring controlled cell growth and preventing tumorigenesis. CTNNB1, while primarily associated with the Wnt signaling pathway, also interacts with components of the PI3K/Akt pathway, adding an additional layer of regulation."	0.95

It specifically hydrolyzes the 5-phosphate from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to generate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), altering the pool of PI(4,5)P2 which is a precursor for second messengers and has a role in various cellular processes including membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organization.

The interaction between SIL1 and INPP5K suggests a link between ER function and phosphoinositide signaling. SIL1's role in assisting protein folding within the ER could be influenced by the membrane dynamics regulated by INPP5K through its phosphatase activity.
