These proteins work together to maintain cellular redox homeostasis.

2. Cellular metabolism regulation: The system includes proteins involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism, such as MTOR, PDK2, and IGF1R. MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) is a central regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and survival, integrating signals from nutrients, growth factors, and energy status. PDK2 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2) regulates glucose metabolism by inhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, while IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) mediates the effects of insulin-like growth factors on cell growth and metabolism.

3. Lipid metabolism: Several proteins are involved in lipid metabolism, including LPL, PPARG, and SLC27A4. LPL (lipoprotein lipase) hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins, providing free fatty acids for cellular uptake and metabolism. PPARG (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) is a nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. SLC27A4 (solute carrier family 27 member 4) is a fatty acid transporter that mediates the uptake of long-chain fatty acids into cells.

4. Vitamin D metabolism: The system includes proteins involved in vitamin D metabolism, such as VDR, CYP24A1, and CYP27B1. VDR (vitamin D receptor) is a nuclear receptor that mediates the effects of active vitamin D on gene expression. CYP24A1 (cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1) and CYP27B1 (cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily B member 1) are enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of active vitamin D, respectively.

5. Bone metabolism: Several proteins are involved in bone metabolism, including RUNX2, PTH, and TNFRSF11B. RUNX2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2) is a transcription factor essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. PTH (parathyroid hormone) regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis, while TNFRSF11B (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 11B) is an osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor that maintains bone mass.

This is evident from the presence of several key proteins involved in inflammation and immune response pathways.

1. TLR family proteins (TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9) are critical for recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiating innate immune responses. They activate downstream signaling pathways, including MYD88 and TRAF6, leading to the activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB and STAT3, which regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

2. Cytokines (IL1A, IL1B, IL6, IL16, IL17A, IL17D, IL17F, IL33, IFNG, TNF) are key mediators of inflammation, regulating immune cell recruitment, activation, and differentiation. The presence of IL17 family members (IL17A, IL17D, IL17F) and their receptors (IL17RA, IL17RC) highlights the involvement of the Th17 pathway, which is crucial for host defense against extracellular pathogens and autoimmune diseases.

3. NOD-like receptors (NOD1, NOD2, NLRP10) are intracellular sensors that recognize microbial components and initiate immune responses. They form inflammasomes, such as the PYCARD-CARD9 complex, which activate caspases and lead to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL1B.

4. The presence of proteins involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (CYBA, NOS2) and stress response (HSPD1, SELENOK) indicates the role of this system in maintaining cellular homeostasis during inflammation.

5. Proteins involved in the regulation of leukocyte adhesion and migration (LPL, PTAFR, CD36, F2R, F2RL1) suggest the system's role in modulating immune cell trafficking during inflammation.

6. The presence of proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression (ARID5A, POU2F1, POU2F2, STAT3, XBP1, ZBTB20) indicates the system's role in controlling the transcriptional response to inflammatory stimuli.

7. Proteins involved in the regulation of cell signaling (BTK, PLCG2, PTPN11, SYK, TIRAP) suggest the system's role in modulating intracellular signaling pathways during inflammation.

In conclusion, the system of interacting proteins primarily regulates the inflammatory response by modulating the recognition of pathogens, production of cytokines, and activation of immune cells. The presence of key proteins involved in inflammation and immune response pathways supports this conclusion."	0.21948268	10228	0.8373997052562633	regulation of inflammatory response|inflammatory response|regulation of acute inflammatory response|regulation of inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus|regulation of neuroinflammatory response|regulation of chronic inflammatory response|regulation of immune response|positive regulation of inflammatory response|regulation of inflammatory response to wounding|regulation of acute inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus	0.96782136|0.87474644|0.8628423|0.8281362|0.8260507|0.82055414|0.7823856|0.7709544|0.7690541|0.7680383	2.669139551007914e-28|5.0069164249395156e-54|0.0007884514851450045|0.0005605648078748518|4.7104057931441217e-07|0.0033774175000296043|1.1416409595798078e-45|1.066905726068265e-33|1.0|0.12575267379713112	6.672848877519785e-28|5.006916424939515e-53|0.0011263592644928635|0.0009342746797914197|9.420811586288243e-07|0.004221771875037005|5.708204797899039e-45|3.55635242022755e-33|1.0|0.13972519310792347	0.08294930875576037|0.0811138014527845|0.02877697841726619|0.02962962962962963|0.04838709677419355|0.019230769230769232|0.07159353348729793|0.14218009478672985|0.0|0.00909090909090909	positive regulation of meiotic cell cycle	0.2322943	9676	0.7922056656296054

Key proteins involved in these processes include GPX1, SOD1, SOD2, CAT, and COX1.

1. Oxidative stress response: GPX1, SOD1, and SOD2 are antioxidant enzymes that neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protect cells from oxidative damage. GPX1 reduces hydrogen peroxide to water, while SOD1 and SOD2 convert superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide. CAT further catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. These proteins work together to maintain redox balance and prevent cellular damage.

2. Mitochondrial function: COX1, ATP6, and ATP5F1A are involved in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. COX1 is a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain. ATP6 and ATP5F1A are subunits of ATP synthase, which generates ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. Proper mitochondrial function is crucial for cellular energy production and overall homeostasis.

3. Cellular stress response: Proteins such as HSP70, HSP90, and HSP27 are molecular chaperones that assist in protein folding, stabilization, and degradation. They play a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis and protecting cells from various stressors, including oxidative stress.

4. Apoptosis regulation: BAK1, APAF1, and CASP9 are involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. BAK1 is a pro-apoptotic protein that promotes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leading to the release of cytochrome c. APAF1 and CASP9 form the apoptosome complex, which activates downstream caspases and ultimately leads to cell death. Proper regulation of apoptosis is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation.

5. Cell cycle regulation: CDKN1C, CDKN2B, and AURKB are involved in cell cycle progression and checkpoint control. CDKN1C and CDKN2B are cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that negatively regulate cell cycle progression, while AURKB is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a role in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. Proper cell cycle regulation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation.

6. Inflammation and immune response: IL10, IL15, and TGFB3 are cytokines that modulate immune cell function and inflammatory responses. IL10 and IL15 are involved in the regulation of T cell and natural killer cell activation, while TGFB3 is involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and extracellular matrix production. Proper regulation of inflammation and immune responses is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing chronic inflammation-associated diseases.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the oxidative stress response and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The proteins involved in this process work together to protect cells from oxidative damage, maintain mitochondrial function, regulate apoptosis, control cell cycle progression, and modulate immune and inflammatory responses."	0.37070224	3084	0.2524971344358932	cellular response to oxidative stress|response to oxidative stress|regulation of cellular response to oxidative stress|regulation of response to oxidative stress|cell redox homeostasis|cellular response to reactive oxygen species|negative regulation of cellular response to oxidative stress|cellular response to redox state|cellular response to hydrogen peroxide|positive regulation of response to oxidative stress	0.8851901|0.8637718|0.8463997|0.8231421|0.81842756|0.765292|0.74413896|0.7438342|0.74219656|0.7383882	1.0001742252358284e-12|1.2829947678478856e-22|4.314845994963275e-05|9.859344937028664e-05|4.0272503511843395e-05|5.430624932652036e-11|1.0|1.0|8.517203860358945e-08|0.008290505228094974	5.000871126179142e-12|1.2829947678478855e-21|7.191409991605459e-05|0.0001408477848146952|7.191409991605459e-05|1.810208310884012e-10|1.0|1.0|2.1293009650897362e-07|0.010363131535118716	0.059665871121718374|0.07664233576642336|0.03278688524590164|0.031496062992125984|0.02926829268292683|0.05821917808219178|0.0|0.0|0.045081967213114756|0.011299435028248588	poly-N-acetyllactosamine biosynthetic process	0.1761563	10880	0.8907810709022433

The innate immune response is the body's first line of defense against pathogens and is crucial for maintaining homeostasis.

1. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play a key role in detecting pathogens and initiating the immune response. In this system, several PRRs are present, including TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, and TLR10. These Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate signaling cascades that lead to the activation of immune cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

2. NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are another group of PRRs involved in the innate immune response. In this system, NLRP1, NLRP2B, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRP10, NLRC4, and NLRC5 are present. These proteins form inflammasomes, which are multiprotein complexes that activate caspase-1, leading to the processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18.

3. C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are also involved in the innate immune response. In this system, CLEC4E, CLEC6A, and CLEC7A are present. These proteins recognize carbohydrate structures on pathogens and initiate signaling pathways that lead to the activation of immune cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

4. Several proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of cytokine production and signaling. For example, IL12A and IL12B are subunits of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12, which is involved in the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. IL17A and IL17F are pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection.

5. The system also includes proteins involved in the regulation of immune cell activation and function.

This pathway is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The Wnt signaling pathway is initiated by the binding of Wnt ligands (e.g., WNT5A) to Frizzled receptors (e.g., FZD4, FZD5, FZD8, FZD10) and co-receptors (e.g., LRP5/6, ROR2). This binding activates the downstream signaling cascade, which involves the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin (CTNNB1) and the activation of target genes.

Key proteins involved in the Wnt signaling pathway include:

1. WNT5A: A Wnt ligand that binds to Frizzled receptors and activates the pathway.
2. FZD4, FZD5, FZD8, FZD10: Frizzled receptors that bind Wnt ligands and initiate the signaling cascade.
3. ROR2: A co-receptor that interacts with Frizzled receptors and Wnt ligands to modulate the pathway.
4. AXIN1: A scaffold protein that forms a complex with β-catenin, GSK3β, and APC, regulating β-catenin stability.
5. DVL2, DVL3: Dishevelled proteins that transduce the signal from Frizzled receptors to downstream components.
6. RAF1: A kinase that can modulate the Wnt signaling pathway through the regulation of β-catenin phosphorylation.
7. AKT1: A kinase that can phosphorylate and inactivate GSK3β, leading to the stabilization of β-catenin.
8. TCF/LEF: Transcription factors that interact with β-catenin to activate target gene expression.

The Wnt signaling pathway is regulated by various proteins, including:

1. DKK1: An antagonist that binds to LRP5/6 and inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway.
2. SIRT1: A deacetylase that can modulate the Wnt signaling pathway by deacetylating β-catenin.
3. TAOK1, TAOK2, TAOK3: Kinases that can phosphorylate and activate TAK1, which in turn modulates the Wnt signaling pathway.

The Wnt signaling pathway interacts with other signaling pathways, such as:

1. TGF-β signaling pathway: TGFB1, a ligand in the TGF-β signaling pathway, can modulate the Wnt signaling pathway by regulating the expression of Wnt ligands and antagonists.
2. MAPK signaling pathway: MAP2K1, MAP2K2, MAP2K5, MAP2K6, and MAP2K7 are kinases involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, which can cross-talk with the Wnt signaling pathway.
3. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway: PIK3CA, PIK3CG, PIK3R1, PIK3R5, and PIK3R6 are components of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which can modulate the Wnt signaling pathway through the regulation of GSK3β activity.

In conclusion, the Wnt signaling pathway is a crucial biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins, regulating various cellular processes and interacting with other signaling pathways."	0.29347947	4409	0.3609792041919109	Wnt signaling pathway|canonical Wnt signaling pathway|cell-cell signaling by wnt|non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt signaling pathway, calcium modulating pathway|regulation of Wnt signaling pathway|positive regulation of Wnt signaling pathway|regulation of non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway|canonical Wnt signaling pathway involved in regulation of cell proliferation|Wnt signaling pathway, planar cell polarity pathway	0.9999999|0.9190836|0.90107286|0.8886236|0.82764864|0.8265207|0.8005681|0.76815945|0.7648002|0.7590256	6.838164826005401e-10|1.5404996614321842e-08|7.665972136696323e-10|2.760001048868261e-06|8.956489287211336e-05|0.0001453760298180832|0.0007461849288810126|0.11013863483967887|0.12000948418775878|0.0008235365200370562	3.832986068348161e-09|5.134998871440614e-08|3.832986068348161e-09|6.900002622170652e-06|0.00017912978574422672|0.0002422933830301387|0.0010294206500463202|0.12000948418775878|0.12000948418775878|0.0010294206500463202	0.050473186119873815|0.048|0.050314465408805034|0.034482758620689655|0.013100436681222707|0.034026465028355386|0.028011204481792718|0.007936507936507936|0.004310344827586207|0.021897810218978103	axial mesoderm morphogenesis	0.3764642	1275	0.10438840674635665

Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that play a crucial role in the innate immune response, particularly in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).

Key proteins involved in inflammasome activation include NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRP7, NLRP10, NLRP12, NLRC4, AIM2, and PYCARD. These proteins are part of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family and the AIM2-like receptor (ALR) family, which are responsible for sensing intracellular danger signals and initiating the assembly of inflammasomes. The activation of these proteins leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein PYCARD (also known as ASC), which in turn recruits and activates caspase-1 (CASP1). Active caspase-1 then cleaves pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18, into their mature forms, leading to an inflammatory response.

Several proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of inflammasome activation. For example, TNFAIP3, also known as A20, is a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of NLRP3. Additionally, IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18.

Other proteins in this system are involved in the recognition of PAMPs and DAMPs, such as TLR4, TLR6, and TLR8, which are part of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. These proteins recognize extracellular and endosomal PAMPs and DAMPs, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which contribute to the transcriptional regulation of inflammasome components.

Furthermore, several proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of cell death, such as CASP8, which can cleave and inactivate the gasdermin D protein (GSDMD), preventing pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death associated with inflammasome activation.

In summary, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in the activation and regulation of inflammasomes, which play a crucial role in the innate immune response to PAMPs and DAMPs. Key proteins in this system include NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRP7, NLRP10, NLRP12, NLRC4, AIM2, PYCARD, CASP1, TNFAIP3, IL-10, TLR4, TLR6, TLR8, and CASP8."	0.37304568	1510	0.1236286228917635	inflammasome complex assembly|NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly|regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly|nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1 signaling pathway|nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway|regulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway|regulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1 signaling pathway|nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 signaling pathway|regulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 signaling pathway|positive regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly	0.86787885|0.80428416|0.79063106|0.7559713|0.75528616|0.74749756|0.7467766|0.72742546|0.72569263|0.7240164	1.8692576995627442e-28|4.917262658925089e-27|2.547074753332291e-23|2.198397497628698e-05|5.2275063441098225e-06|0.007892028901961421|0.0006457572531206881|4.634161731875807e-07|0.0029317718085188176|8.800691167133763e-12	1.869257699562744e-27|2.4586313294625444e-26|8.490249177774303e-23|3.1405678537552834e-05|8.712510573516372e-06|0.007892028901961421|0.0008071965664008601|9.268323463751614e-07|0.003257524231687575|2.2001727917834406e-11	0.13934426229508196|0.1322314049586777|0.11570247933884298|0.02586206896551724|0.03759398496240601|0.016129032258064516|0.017391304347826087|0.04032258064516129|0.01680672268907563|0.059322033898305086	positive regulation of mRNA binding	0.2896664	5666	0.4638938922547896

5. Kinases and phosphatases: PRKCI, PRKCQ, PRKCZ, PRKCB, PRKCH, CAMK2A, and EIF2AK2 are kinases that regulate inflammasome activation through phosphorylation of target proteins. In contrast, phosphatases such as PTPN22 and DUSP3 dephosphorylate target proteins, modulating inflammasome activation.

6. Cell death and survival: Proteins such as RIPK1, RIPK2, RIPK3, CFLAR, and FADD are involved in the regulation of cell death pathways, including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. These proteins can either promote or inhibit cell death, depending on the cellular context and the specific interactions with other proteins in the system.

7. Transcriptional regulation: EP300, RELA, and STAT3 are transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in inflammasome activation and the inflammatory response. These proteins modulate the transcription of target genes in response to various stimuli, including PAMPs, DAMPs, and cytokines.

In conclusion, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in the activation and regulation of inflammasomes, which play a crucial role in the innate immune response. The proteins in this system participate in various aspects of inflammasome activation, including PRR signaling, cytokine production, post-translational modifications, and transcriptional regulation."	0.33517176	2936	0.2403798919272965	inflammasome complex assembly|NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly|regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly|nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1 signaling pathway|nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway|regulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway|regulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1 signaling pathway|nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 signaling pathway|regulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 signaling pathway|positive regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly	0.86787885|0.80428416|0.79063106|0.7559713|0.75528616|0.74749756|0.7467766|0.72742546|0.72569263|0.7240164	5.3191554682947486e-11|2.2811958775838726e-11|1.5886256269178957e-08|0.0029719864969626666|4.318341561685267e-08|0.0007521261560498953|0.05634412702260368|5.734474010462688e-08|0.0001552821816486347|6.939840506046563e-09	2.659577734147374e-10|2.2811958775838724e-10|3.971564067294739e-08|0.0033022072188474074|8.636683123370534e-08|0.0009401576950623692|0.05634412702260368|9.55745668410448e-08|0.00022183168806947813|2.313280168682188e-08	0.05232558139534884|0.052941176470588235|0.041176470588235294|0.012578616352201259|0.04046242774566474|0.01818181818181818|0.006329113924050633|0.03636363636363636|0.01875|0.037267080745341616	transcription initiation at RNA polymerase III promoter	0.21128766	10127	0.829130505976748

1. Inflammatory response regulation: Proteins such as NLRP3, IL1B, IL6, IL17A, IL18, IL33, and TNFSF4 are known to play crucial roles in the regulation of inflammation. For instance, NLRP3 is a component of the inflammasome, which is responsible for the activation of inflammatory cytokines like IL1B and IL18. IL6 and IL17A are pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to the inflammatory response.

2. Immune response regulation: Proteins such as IL4, IL10, IL13, IL21, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR9, CD40, and CD86 are involved in modulating immune responses. For example, IL4 and IL13 are anti-inflammatory cytokines that promote the differentiation of T-helper 2 (Th2) cells, while IL10 is an immunosuppressive cytokine that inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. TLRs (Toll-like receptors) are pattern recognition receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and initiate innate immune responses.

3. T cell activation and differentiation: Proteins such as CD28, TBX21, GATA3, and STAT6 are involved in T cell activation and differentiation.

The proteins in this system can be classified into several categories, including nuclear receptors, coactivators, corepressors, and other interacting proteins.

Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a family of transcription factors that regulate gene expression in response to ligand binding. Key NRs in this system include NR2C1, NR2F1, NR2E3, NR4A3, NR1D1, NR1H4, NR1H3, NR3C1, NR1D2, NR3C2, NR2E1, NR2C2, NR4A1, NR4A2, NR5A2, NR6A1, and NR1H2. These receptors are involved in various biological processes, such as metabolism, development, and immune response.

Coactivators and corepressors are proteins that modulate the activity of nuclear receptors. Coactivators, such as NCOA1, NCOA2, NCOA4, and MED1, enhance the transcriptional activity of NRs, while corepressors, such as NCOR1, NCOR2, and GPS2, inhibit their activity. The balance between coactivators and corepressors determines the transcriptional output of NRs.

Other interacting proteins in this system include enzymes involved in post-translational modifications, such as SIRT1, KMT2D, KDM4C, CARM1, PRMT2, EZH2, KDM1A, KDM3A, KDM5D, and HDAC1. These enzymes modulate the activity of NRs and their interacting proteins by adding or removing chemical groups, such as acetyl, methyl, or phosphate groups.

Several proteins in this system are involved in protein-protein interactions and protein stability, such as USP17L2, RNF34, NEDD4, UFL1, RNF6, SKP2, TRIM15, TRIM24, TRIM25, TRIM68, ITCH, UBE3A, and UBR5. These proteins regulate the stability and function of NRs and their interacting proteins through ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes.

Additionally, proteins involved in signal transduction and immune response, such as RIPK2, MYD88, TLR4, TLR8, TLR3, IRAK4, TRAF6, IRF7, and IRF3, are present in this system. These proteins modulate the activity of NRs in response to various stimuli, such as cytokines, pathogens, and environmental factors.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is nuclear receptor signaling. This process is crucial for regulating gene expression in response to various stimuli and is modulated by a complex network of proteins, including nuclear receptors, coactivators, corepressors, enzymes involved in post-translational modifications, and proteins involved in protein-protein interactions and protein stability."	0.7312475	9	0.0007368593417389	intracellular steroid hormone receptor signaling pathway|hormone-mediated signaling pathway|retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway|steroid hormone mediated signaling pathway|ER-nucleus signaling pathway|signaling|androgen receptor signaling pathway|intracellular estrogen receptor signaling pathway|intracellular receptor signaling pathway|regulation of intracellular steroid hormone receptor signaling pathway	0.8167679|0.7647705|0.7645653|0.75703275|0.75015414|0.74225885|0.7416408|0.73370117|0.7312475|0.72605956	4.685133881190798e-192|6.417260635048806e-193|1.2990819258290294e-49|4.8501491168845645e-204|0.7356962611438378|1.7689985533244492e-72|2.0023381721616596e-75|7.510290836995782e-87|0.0|1.2628484930723154e-116	1.1712834702976994e-191|2.139086878349602e-192|1.4434243620322548e-49|2.4250745584422822e-203|0.7356962611438378|2.2112481916555615e-72|2.860483103088085e-75|1.2517151394992972e-86|0.0|2.525696986144631e-116	0.38666666666666666|0.40625|0.10333333333333333|0.4201954397394137|0.002890173410404624|0.04782400765184122|0.15666666666666668|0.18|1.0|0.24	positive regulation of chondrocyte proliferation	0.18329278	10878	0.8906173243818569

Intraflagellar Transport: IFT proteins, such as IFT27, IFT43, IFT46, IFT52, IFT57, IFT74, IFT80, IFT81, IFT88, IFT122, IFT140, and IFT172, are crucial for the bidirectional movement of protein complexes along the ciliary axoneme. These proteins form IFT complexes that interact with motor proteins, such as kinesin-2 (KIF3A, KIF3B) and dynein-2 (DYNC2H1, DYNC2I1, DYNC2I2, DYNC2LI1), to facilitate the transport of ciliary components.

3. Ciliary Dysfunction and Disease: Mutations in ciliary proteins can lead to a range of human diseases called ciliopathies, which include Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), Joubert syndrome (JBTS), and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Key proteins associated with these diseases include BBS proteins (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS9, BBS10, BBS12), MKS proteins (MKS1, TMEM67, CC2D2A, RPGRIP1L, CEP290, TCTN2), JBTS proteins (AHI1, TMEM216, TMEM138, TMEM237, CEP41, TCTN1, TCTN3), and PCD proteins (DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAI3, DNAI4, DNAH1, DNAH2, DNAH5, DNAH7, DNAH8, DNAH17, DNAAF1, DNAAF2, DNAAF3, DNAAF4, DNAAF5, DNAAF6, DNAAF8, DNAAF10, DNAAF11).

4. Ciliary Signaling Pathways: Cilia are involved in several signaling pathways, such as Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt, and Notch signaling. Key proteins in these pathways include GLI transcription factors (GLI1, GLI2, GLI3), which are regulated by Hh signaling, Dishevelled (DVL1, DVL2, DVL3) proteins, which are involved in Wnt signaling, and NOTCH1, which is a receptor in the Notch signaling pathway. These signaling pathways play crucial roles in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis.

In conclusion, the interacting proteins in this system are primarily involved in ciliogenesis and intraflagellar transport, which are essential for the assembly, maintenance, and function of cilia. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to ciliopathies and affect various signaling pathways, highlighting the importance of these proteins in cellular processes and human health."	0.7516558	7	0.0005731128213525	intraciliary transport involved in cilium assembly|non-motile cilium assembly|motile cilium assembly|cilium assembly|protein transport from ciliary membrane to plasma membrane|cilium-dependent cell motility|cilium organization|cilium movement|intraciliary transport|cilium movement involved in cell motility	0.86972797|0.7699005|0.7631325|0.76282597|0.76164293|0.7537068|0.7516558|0.7498727|0.7485926|0.7444755	1.263683846415546e-10|1.3181505390961902e-97|1.108776062746775e-91|0.0|0.0015028694506358689|1.4328092525690867e-65|0.0|2.3935458355434116e-102|3.6101932069587727e-68|1.3926882824342352e-57	1.40409316268394e-10|3.2953763477404753e-97|2.21755212549355e-91|0.0|0.0015028694506358689|2.046870360812981e-65|0.0|7.978486118478038e-102|6.016988678264622e-68|1.740860353042794e-57	0.01674641148325359|0.16028708133971292|0.1507177033492823|0.930622009569378|0.004784688995215311|0.15169660678642716|1.0|0.21188118811881188|0.11244019138755981|0.13709677419354838	negative regulation of ryanodine-sensitive calcium-release channel activity	0.19760036	10022	0.8205338136564598

Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, while cell migration is the movement of cells from one location to another.

1. Key proteins in angiogenesis: VEGFA, VEGFC, KDR, ANGPT1, ANGPT2, ANGPT4, and TEK are all involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. VEGFA and VEGFC are potent angiogenic factors that bind to their respective receptors, KDR and FLT4, to promote endothelial cell proliferation and migration. ANGPT1, ANGPT2, and ANGPT4 are angiopoietins that regulate blood vessel maturation and stability by interacting with the TEK receptor.

2. Key proteins in cell migration: RHOA, ROCK1, ROCK2, PTK2, and PTK2B are involved in the regulation of cell migration. RHOA is a small GTPase that controls actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration. ROCK1 and ROCK2 are RHOA effectors that regulate actomyosin contractility and cell motility. PTK2 and PTK2B are focal adhesion kinases that mediate integrin signaling and cell migration.

3. Cross-talk between angiogenesis and cell migration: Several proteins, such as PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, PIK3CG, and PIK3R3, are involved in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, which regulates both angiogenesis and cell migration. Activation of PI3K signaling promotes endothelial cell survival, proliferation, and migration during angiogenesis, as well as the migration of various cell types.

4. Regulation of angiogenesis and cell migration: Various transcription factors, such as ETS1, FOXC2, GATA2, GATA3, SNAI1, SNAI2, SOX9, and ZEB2, are involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and cell migration. These transcription factors control the expression of genes that are critical for endothelial cell differentiation, blood vessel formation, and cell motility.

5. Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling: Proteins such as MMP9, ADAM9, ADAM17, and LOXL2 are involved in ECM remodeling, which is essential for angiogenesis and cell migration. ECM remodeling allows cells to degrade and reorganize the surrounding matrix, facilitating their movement and the formation of new blood vessels.

6. Inhibition of angiogenesis and cell migration: Proteins such as THBS1, SPARC, and SERPINF1 are involved in the inhibition of angiogenesis and cell migration. These proteins can negatively regulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and blood vessel formation, maintaining a balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors.

In conclusion, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in the biological processes of angiogenesis and cell migration. The proteins regulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and blood vessel formation, as well as the movement of various cell types. The system also includes proteins that modulate ECM remodeling and inhibit angiogenesis and cell migration, maintaining a balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors."	0.72247374	14	0.001146225642705	angiogenesis|cell migration involved in sprouting angiogenesis|endothelial cell migration|blood vessel endothelial cell migration|cell migration involved in vasculogenesis|sprouting angiogenesis|mesenchymal cell migration|angiogenesis involved in wound healing|cell migration|endothelial cell morphogenesis	0.8572147|0.8445148|0.8245489|0.7971822|0.7791578|0.7749427|0.77204|0.7640844|0.7505971|0.743899	5.542026240457871e-152|6.357810323650282e-86|0.0|1.6229185174309345e-191|1.0|2.0531651631485567e-93|6.56215339729442e-05|8.43245061740885e-11|5.269679063274065e-268|0.04532095826948539	1.3855065601144677e-151|1.0596350539417138e-85|0.0|5.4097283914364483e-191|1.0|4.106330326297113e-93|8.202691746618025e-05|1.2046358024869786e-10|2.634839531637032e-267|0.05035662029942821	0.2617246596066566|0.17363344051446947|0.7041800643086816|0.3762057877813505|0.0|0.22284122562674094|0.024725274725274724|0.03363914373088685|0.2042581503659348|0.006230529595015576	pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate metabolic process	0.30774248	6368	0.5213689209104306

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the development of diseases such as cancer. The proteins involved in this process can be classified into pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins.

Pro-apoptotic proteins include BAK1, BID, BAX, BAD, BCL2L11, FAS, FASLG, TNF, TNFRSF10A, TNFRSF10B, TNFRSF10C, TNFSF10, DAPK1, CASP2, CASP8, FADD, and RIPK1. These proteins promote cell death by activating the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. For example, BAK1 and BAX are members of the BCL2 family that promote mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leading to the release of cytochrome c and activation of caspases. FAS, FASLG, and TNF are involved in the extrinsic pathway, which is initiated by the binding of death ligands to their respective receptors, leading to the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and activation of caspase-8.

Anti-apoptotic proteins include BCL2, BCL2L1, BCL2L2, BCL2L10, BCL2L12, BCL2L14, BCL2A1, MCL1, XIAP, and CFLAR. These proteins inhibit apoptosis by preventing the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins or by directly inhibiting caspases. For example, BCL2 and BCL2L1 inhibit the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, while XIAP and CFLAR inhibit caspase activation.

Several proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of apoptosis through various signaling pathways. AKT1, RAF1, and MAPK7 are kinases that can promote cell survival by phosphorylating and inactivating pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAD and caspase-9. PTEN and GSK3B are negative regulators of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which can promote apoptosis when inhibited. FOXO3 and P53 are transcription factors that can induce the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, while NF-κB (RELA) can induce the expression of anti-apoptotic genes.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of apoptosis. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the development of diseases such as cancer. The proteins involved in this process can be classified into pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins, and their activities are regulated by various signaling pathways."	0.615529	82	0.0067136073358441	regulation of apoptotic process|regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway|apoptotic process|apoptotic signaling pathway|regulation of apoptotic cell clearance|regulation of cell death|regulation of lymphocyte apoptotic process|positive regulation of apoptotic process|regulation of programmed cell death|regulation of apoptotic process involved in development	0.9274744|0.8377937|0.8367342|0.82713234|0.8037683|0.7860017|0.7749716|0.7746077|0.7717397|0.7696558	6.22199095438024e-151|3.4201030815739573e-211|6.03606516991976e-173|7.923933912502818e-301|1.0|6.88023656012532e-142|4.4996755816866955e-08|5.6377542705189525e-65|4.611611666073322e-149|7.637952826779483e-05	1.5554977385950597e-150|1.7100515407869785e-210|2.0120217233065866e-172|7.923933912502817e-300|1.0|1.14670609335422e-141|5.624594477108369e-08|8.053934672169933e-65|9.223223332146644e-149|8.486614251977204e-05	0.13513513513513514|0.3952380952380952|0.11696522655426765|0.3769100169779287|0.0|0.12093862815884476|0.040293040293040296|0.14556962025316456|0.13245033112582782|0.017391304347826087	regulation of adherens junction organization	0.46173874	579	0.0474046176518749

The following points support this analysis:

1. Presence of key inflammatory regulators: Proteins such as NLRP3, IL10, TNFAIP3, and IL12B are known to play crucial roles in regulating inflammation. NLRP3 is a component of the inflammasome, which is involved in the activation of inflammatory responses. IL10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that helps in controlling excessive inflammation.

2. Involvement in immune cell signaling: Several proteins in the system, such as PTPRC, SYK, and FYN, are involved in immune cell signaling pathways. PTPRC (CD45) is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a critical role in T and B cell antigen receptor signaling. SYK and FYN are non-receptor tyrosine kinases that participate in various immune cell signaling pathways.

3. Regulation of immune cell activation and differentiation: Proteins like FOXP3, GATA3, and SMAD3 are involved in the regulation of immune cell activation and differentiation. FOXP3 is a transcription factor that is essential for the development and function of regulatory T cells, which help in maintaining immune tolerance. GATA3 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the differentiation of T helper 2 (Th2) cells, which are involved in humoral immunity and allergic responses.

4. Involvement in antigen presentation and recognition: The presence of proteins such as HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-E, HLA-G, and HLA-DRB1 indicates the involvement of this system in antigen presentation and recognition. These proteins are part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules, which are essential for presenting antigens to T cells and initiating adaptive immune responses.

5. Modulation of immune checkpoints: Proteins like HAVCR2 (TIM-3) and CD96 are immune checkpoint molecules that play a role in regulating immune responses. HAVCR2 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, and its interaction with its ligands can lead to T cell exhaustion and immune tolerance.

6. Involvement in cytokine signaling and regulation: Several proteins in the system, such as STAT2, SOCS3, and SOCS5, are involved in cytokine signaling and regulation. STAT2 is a transcription factor that mediates signaling downstream of type I interferons, which are essential for antiviral immune responses. SOCS3 and SOCS5 are suppressors of cytokine signaling that help in maintaining immune homeostasis by negatively regulating cytokine-induced signaling pathways.

In conclusion, the system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in the regulation of inflammation and modulation of immune responses. This is supported by the presence of key inflammatory regulators, proteins involved in immune cell signaling, regulation of immune cell activation and differentiation, antigen presentation and recognition, immune checkpoint modulation, and cytokine signaling and regulation."	0.41041934	871	0.0713116096282954	regulation of inflammatory response|regulation of immune response|regulation of inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus|regulation of neuroinflammatory response|regulation of immunoglobulin mediated immune response|regulation of innate immune response|inflammatory response|regulation of immune system process|regulation of tolerance induction dependent upon immune response|regulation of leukocyte mediated immunity	0.8297123|0.7944542|0.76440024|0.7477273|0.7421285|0.7385441|0.73779166|0.71921885|0.715729|0.7107436	7.237572645326409e-175|2.177309908638973e-117|2.4739744202943663e-38|6.373633848114832e-15|1.40159657205514e-08|4.905057974112923e-107|2.1681857372289446e-126|7.318042840576991e-118|0.0015230096709608872|4.895838379033046e-30	7.237572645326409e-174|5.443274771597432e-117|4.1232907004906106e-38|7.967042310143539e-15|1.557329524505711e-08|9.810115948225846e-107|1.0840928686144723e-125|2.4393476135256638e-117|0.0015230096709608872|6.994054827190067e-30	0.33405172413793105|0.1719260065288357|0.11196911196911197|0.052830188679245285|0.04054054054054054|0.23138832997987926|0.18409090909090908|0.12763068567549218|0.008130081300813009|0.10478359908883828	galactose transmembrane transport	0.13295068	11890	0.9734730636973964

The Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) is a key regulator of mitosis, and several proteins in this system, such as CDC20, CDC23, CDC16, ANAPC15, ANAPC5, ANAPC11, and ANAPC4, are components of the APC. The APC functions in the regulation of sister chromatid separation and mitotic exit by targeting specific proteins for degradation, such as securin and cyclin B1 (CCNB1).

The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures proper chromosome segregation by monitoring kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Key SAC proteins in this system include BUB1, BUB1B, BUB3, MAD1L1, MAD2L1, MAD2L1BP, MAD2L2, TTK, and ZW10. These proteins function to inhibit the APC until all chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle microtubules.

CENPE, NDC80, NUF2, SPC24, SPC25, and KNTC1 are essential for kinetochore-microtubule attachment and chromosome alignment. CENPF and CENPE are motor proteins that facilitate chromosome congression to the metaphase plate. PLK1 and AURKB are kinases that regulate various aspects of mitosis, including centrosome maturation, spindle assembly, and cytokinesis.

The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is involved in the regulation of gene expression and DNA repair. Several proteins in this system, such as SMARCA4, SMARCA2, SMARCC1, SMARCC2, SMARCB1, SMARCD1, SMARCD2, SMARCD3, ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, ACTL6A, ACTL6B, and DPF1, are components of this complex.

Key proteins include PFKM, BAD, EGF, INS, PRKCE, and EGFR.

1. PFKM (Phosphofructokinase, Muscle) is a key enzyme in glycolysis, catalyzing the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. This step is a major control point in glycolysis, as it is both irreversible and highly regulated by allosteric effectors and covalent modification.

2. BAD (BCL2 Associated Agonist of Cell Death) is a pro-apoptotic protein that belongs to the BCL2 family. It promotes cell death by binding to anti-apoptotic proteins, such as BCL2 and BCL-XL, and preventing their protective effects. BAD is regulated by phosphorylation, which can be mediated by kinases such as AKT1 and PRKCE.

3. EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) is a growth factor that binds to the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) and activates downstream signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. These pathways regulate cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation.

4. INS (Insulin) is a hormone that regulates glucose homeostasis by promoting glucose uptake and utilization in target tissues, such as muscle and adipose tissue. It binds to the insulin receptor (INSR) and activates downstream signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT pathway.

5. PRKCE (Protein Kinase C Epsilon) is a member of the protein kinase C family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. PRKCE is activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and calcium ions and can phosphorylate target proteins, such as BAD, to regulate their function.

6. EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated upon binding to its ligands, such as EGF. Activation of EGFR leads to autophosphorylation and recruitment of downstream signaling proteins, initiating signaling cascades that regulate cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation.

In summary, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in the regulation of glycolysis and cellular signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation."	0.17628072	11287	0.9241034878008842	glucose mediated signaling pathway|regulation of glucose mediated signaling pathway|cellular response to glucose starvation|regulation of glycolytic process|hexose mediated signaling|cellular glucose homeostasis|cellular response to glucose stimulus|canonical glycolysis|cellular response to oxygen-glucose deprivation|regulation of glycogen metabolic process	0.7908628|0.76630163|0.750782|0.7344619|0.72374225|0.7162492|0.71418375|0.7022697|0.6924252|0.67915523	0.2593353283372179|1.0|0.02488536562616801|2.388567388038059e-05|0.2593353283372179|1.586035359572079e-33|3.065507396939715e-31|0.14334292266936888|1.0|5.849748982632125e-06	0.32416916042152233|1.0|0.04977073125233602|5.971418470095147e-05|0.32416916042152233|1.586035359572079e-32|1.5327536984698574e-30|0.23890487111561481|1.0|1.9499163275440417e-05	0.002183406113537118|0.0|0.012|0.02040816326530612|0.002183406113537118|0.09289617486338798|0.08614232209737828|0.004291845493562232|0.0|0.018907563025210083	DNA catabolic process, exonucleolytic	0.25021908	9197	0.7529883739970525

Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that play a crucial role in the innate immune response, particularly in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).

Key proteins involved in inflammasome activation include NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRP7, NLRP12, NLRC4, AIM2, and PYCARD. These proteins are part of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family and the PYHIN family, which are responsible for recognizing PAMPs and DAMPs and initiating the assembly of inflammasomes. The activation of inflammasomes leads to the activation of caspase-1 (CASP1), which in turn cleaves pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 into their active forms, promoting inflammation.

Several proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of inflammasome activation. For example, TNFAIP3 and CARD8 negatively regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome, while SERPINB1 inhibits caspase-1 activity. Additionally, TLR4, TLR6, and TLR8, which are part of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, can modulate inflammasome activation through the adaptor protein MYD88.

Other proteins in this system are involved in various aspects of the immune response, such as chemotaxis (CCL19, CCL3, CX3CL1, CX3CR1), phagocytosis (CD36, SIRPA), and immune cell signaling (STAT3, JAK2). Furthermore, proteins like APOA1, ORM1, and ORM2 are involved in the acute-phase response, while proteins like WNT5A, FZD5, and SMAD3 are involved in the regulation of immune cell differentiation and function.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the activation and regulation of inflammasomes, which play a crucial role in the innate immune response. This system also includes proteins involved in various aspects of the immune response, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, immune cell signaling, and the acute-phase response."	0.3774582	1385	0.1133944653676109	inflammasome complex assembly|NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly|regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly|nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1 signaling pathway|nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway|regulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing signaling pathway|regulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1 signaling pathway|nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 signaling pathway|regulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 signaling pathway|positive regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly	0.86787885|0.80428416|0.79063106|0.7559713|0.75528616|0.74749756|0.7467766|0.72742546|0.72569263|0.7240164	1.1309772489918204e-29|3.557642053588703e-28|2.626686961318944e-24|1.3890392803376401e-05|2.460575124958133e-06|0.005870306418421841|0.0004760812330746532|2.1570587626483453e-07|0.0021700233684318793|2.946615391618575e-12	1.1309772489918203e-28|1.7788210267943512e-27|8.75562320439648e-24|1.9843418290537718e-05|4.1009585415968885e-06|0.005870306418421841|0.0005951015413433165|4.3141175252966905e-07|0.0024111370760354213|7.366538479046437e-12	0.16037735849056603|0.1523809523809524|0.13333333333333333|0.03|0.042735042735042736|0.018518518518518517|0.020202020202020204|0.046296296296296294|0.019417475728155338|0.06862745098039216	sperm capacitation	0.33334965	3019	0.24717537252333388

The presence of multiple Rho GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) in the system highlights the importance of Rho GTPase regulation.

Key proteins involved in Rho GTPase regulation include ARHGAPs (e.g., ARHGAP11A, ARHGAP22, ARHGAP24, ARHGAP27, ARHGAP29, ARHGAP35, ARHGAP42, ARHGAP45, and ARHGAP6), RALGAPs (e.g., RALGAPA1, RALGAPA2, RALGAPB), and RASGRFs (e.g., RASGRF1, RASGRF2). These proteins function as GAPs, promoting the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, thereby inactivating Rho GTPases. Conversely, Rho GEFs, such as ARHGEFs (e.g., ARHGEF5, ARHGEF7, ARHGEF15, ARHGEF16, ARHGEF19, ARHGEF26), VAV1, and TIAM1/2, facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP, activating Rho GTPases.

Additionally, the system includes several regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins (e.g., RGS1, RGS4, RGS6, RGS8, RGS10, RGS11, RGS14, RGS16), which modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. GPCRs can activate Rho GTPases through G proteins, further emphasizing the importance of Rho GTPase regulation in this system.

The presence of chemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CCL11, CCL13, CCL14, CCL15, CCL16, CCL17, CCL18, CCL19, CCL20, CCL21, CCL22, CCL23, CCL24, CCL25, CCL26, CX3CL1, CXCL13) and their receptors (e.g., CCR7, S1PR1) suggests a role for this system in chemotaxis and immune cell regulation. Chemokines can activate Rho GTPases through GPCRs, linking chemotaxis to Rho GTPase signaling.

The system also contains proteins involved in cell adhesion (e.g., ITGA6, ITGB1, LIMS1, FERMT2, F11R) and cytoskeletal organization (e.g., CRK, CRKL, CORO1C, MAPRE2, AFDN, BIN1, NDEL1), which are processes regulated by Rho GTPases. Furthermore, proteins such as TSC1/2, GSK3B, AKT2, and PTK2B are involved in the regulation of cell growth and survival, which can be influenced by Rho GTPase signaling.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of Rho GTPase signaling, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, cell adhesion, and chemotaxis."	0.46014506	232	0.0189945963648272	regulation of Rho protein signal transduction|Rho protein signal transduction|regulation of Rho-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity|positive regulation of Rho protein signal transduction|negative regulation of Rho protein signal transduction|regulation of small GTPase mediated signal transduction|regulation of Cdc42 protein signal transduction|regulation of Ras protein signal transduction|regulation of rhodopsin mediated signaling pathway|regulation of Ral protein signal transduction	0.9047582|0.79768014|0.7958574|0.78246033|0.7734474|0.76407564|0.69960093|0.6994394|0.6857017|0.6814586	8.947860260773585e-10|5.378400873116312e-10|0.12467982485179588|0.00022585654129842741|0.00022052571119596815|2.554270947367438e-52|0.1919206029435803|4.6277496634907514e-20|1.0|1.79562538563183e-05	2.2369650651933963e-09|1.7928002910387708e-09|0.15584978106474484|0.00032265220185489634|0.00032265220185489634|2.554270947367438e-51|0.21324511438175586|2.313874831745376e-19|1.0|3.59125077126366e-05	0.04507042253521127|0.04975124378109453|0.003484320557491289|0.01929260450160772|0.016666666666666666|0.14481409001956946|0.0034482758620689655|0.07954545454545454|0.0|0.01060070671378092	sensory neuron axon guidance	0.27871916	3947	0.32315375798264284

This conclusion is based on the presence of several key proteins involved in these processes, such as RANK (TNFRSF11A), RANKL (TNFSF11), OPG (TNFRSF11B), and CSF1R.

1. RANK (TNFRSF11A) and RANKL (TNFSF11) interaction: RANKL, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, binds to its receptor RANK on the surface of osteoclast precursors, promoting their differentiation into mature osteoclasts. This interaction is crucial for osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.

2. OPG (TNFRSF11B) as a decoy receptor: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL, preventing its interaction with RANK and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. The balance between RANKL and OPG determines the rate of bone resorption.

3. CSF1R and its role in osteoclastogenesis: Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) is a tyrosine kinase receptor expressed on osteoclast precursors. Its activation by CSF1 promotes the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of these cells, contributing to osteoclastogenesis.

4. Involvement of other proteins in bone remodeling: Several other proteins in this system are involved in bone remodeling, such as WNT16 (involved in osteoblast differentiation), PTH (regulates calcium homeostasis and bone resorption), and TGF-β1 (involved in both bone formation and resorption).

5. Inflammatory cytokines and their role in bone remodeling: Some proteins in this system, such as IL-6, IL-1A, and TNFAIP3, are inflammatory cytokines that can modulate bone remodeling by influencing osteoclast and osteoblast activity.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is osteoclastogenesis and bone remodeling, as evidenced by the presence of key proteins such as RANK, RANKL, OPG, and CSF1R, as well as other proteins involved in bone metabolism and inflammation."	0.52477765	60	0.0049123956115932	osteoclast differentiation|osteoclast development|bone remodeling|ossification involved in bone remodeling|bone resorption|osteoclast fusion|osteoclast proliferation|multinuclear osteoclast differentiation|bone regeneration|regulation of bone remodeling	0.8400128|0.8235667|0.7789772|0.7630418|0.7517322|0.74477637|0.7299877|0.7260796|0.6975239|0.6706954	9.583682702212773e-42|2.0214463082341647e-07|1.8956425872069493e-176|8.446265718803571e-10|1.6355298605594724e-120|0.08952333705192914|3.617809237046263e-07|0.006293871563889685|1.0|8.51380584143784e-91	2.395920675553193e-41|3.3690771803902746e-07|1.895642587206949e-175|1.6892531437607143e-09|8.177649302797361e-120|0.09947037450214348|5.168298910066091e-07|0.007867339454862106|1.0|2.83793528047928e-90	0.15879828326180256|0.0335195530726257|0.5389221556886228|0.029940119760479042|0.3772455089820359|0.005813953488372093|0.028901734104046242|0.011560693641618497|0.0|0.2874251497005988	homeostasis of number of cells within a tissue	0.3873289	1733	0.14188635991485182

3. SEMA3A-NRP1 interaction: SEMA3A preferentially binds to NRP1, and this interaction is crucial for the repulsive guidance of axons. The binding of SEMA3A to NRP1 activates downstream signaling pathways, such as the Rho family of GTPases, which regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and ultimately lead to axon repulsion.

4. SEMA3F-NRP2 interaction: SEMA3F preferentially binds to NRP2, and this interaction is also important for axonal guidance. The SEMA3F-NRP2 complex activates similar downstream signaling pathways as the SEMA3A-NRP1 complex, leading to axon repulsion.

5. Complementary expression patterns: The expression patterns of SEMA3A and SEMA3F, as well as NRP1 and NRP2, are complementary in the developing nervous system. This complementary expression ensures that the appropriate semaphorin-neuropilin interactions occur, allowing for precise axonal guidance.

6. Functional redundancy: Although SEMA3A and SEMA3F have distinct binding preferences for NRP1 and NRP2, respectively, they can also bind to the other neuropilin receptor with lower affinity. This functional redundancy provides a backup mechanism for axonal guidance in case one of the semaphorin-neuropilin interactions is disrupted.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by the interacting proteins SEMA3F, SEMA3A, NRP2, and NRP1 is axonal guidance. The specific interactions between semaphorins and neuropilins, as well as their complementary expression patterns and functional redundancy, ensure the proper guidance of axons during neural development."	0.42710134	1086	0.0889143605698379	axon guidance|regulation of axon guidance|anterior/posterior axon guidance|axon extension involved in axon guidance|neuron projection guidance|positive regulation of axon guidance|dorsal/ventral axon guidance|axonogenesis|axonal transport|motor neuron axon guidance	0.96354395|0.85946983|0.8552217|0.8529097|0.8192867|0.8089547|0.8051903|0.8032866|0.79946077|0.79676867	2.3659979651974483e-07|0.0044500001011733535|1.0|1.317452681051867e-10|2.40609962561956e-07|0.0014849874624431156|1.0|2.8255072196773285e-06|1.0|9.512367102752262e-08	6.0152490640489e-07|0.00635714300167622|1.0|1.317452681051867e-09|6.0152490640489e-07|0.0024749791040718596|1.0|5.651014439354657e-06|1.0|4.756183551376131e-07	0.016736401673640166|0.06666666666666667|0.0|0.10526315789473684|0.016666666666666666|0.14285714285714285|0.0|0.009029345372460496|0.0|0.09090909090909091	organic hydroxy compound transport	0.36068475	2851	0.23342066481087276

Gap junctions are intercellular channels that allow direct communication between neighboring cells through the exchange of ions, small molecules, and electrical signals. The presence of multiple connexin proteins suggests that the primary function of this system is the formation and regulation of gap junctions.

2. Heteromeric/heterotypic channels: Different connexin proteins can combine to form heteromeric (different connexins within the same hemichannel) and heterotypic (different connexins in opposing hemichannels) gap junction channels. This increases the diversity of channel properties and allows for more precise regulation of intercellular communication. The interaction between GJB5, GJB2, and GJB1 may result in the formation of such channels, contributing to the complexity of the system.

3. PTPN6 regulation: PTPN6, also known as SHP-1, is a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. PTPN6 may interact with the connexin proteins to regulate gap junction formation and function. For example, PTPN6 could dephosphorylate connexins, leading to changes in channel properties or the disassembly of gap junctions.

4. Implications in disease: Mutations in GJB2 are known to cause autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss, highlighting the importance of proper gap junction function in the auditory system. Additionally, alterations in gap junction communication have been implicated in various pathological conditions, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Understanding the interactions between GJB5, GJB2, GJB1, and PTPN6 may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases and potential therapeutic targets.

GO:0036486	SEMA3F NRP1 NRP2	3	ventral trunk neural crest cell migration	Axonal Guidance	"Protein Interaction:
SEMA3F, a member of the semaphorin family, is a secreted protein that plays a crucial role in axonal guidance. It interacts with neuropilin receptors, NRP1 and NRP2, to mediate its effects on axon guidance and neuronal development.

Axonal Guidance:
SEMA3F-NRP1/NRP2 interaction is essential for the proper guidance of axons during neuronal development. SEMA3F acts as a repulsive guidance cue, directing axons away from areas with high SEMA3F concentration. This is achieved through the binding of SEMA3F to NRP1 and NRP2 receptors on the growth cones of developing axons.

SEMA3F-NRP1 Interaction:
The binding of SEMA3F to NRP1 induces a conformational change in the receptor, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways. This activation results in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and the collapse of the growth cone, ultimately causing axon repulsion. The specificity of SEMA3F-NRP1 interaction is supported by the presence of a conserved binding site in the SEMA3F protein, which is essential for its interaction with NRP1.

SEMA3F-NRP2 Interaction:
SEMA3F can also bind to NRP2, another neuropilin receptor. The SEMA3F-NRP2 interaction is less well understood compared to the SEMA3F-NRP1 interaction. However, it is known that SEMA3F-NRP2 binding can also lead to axon repulsion, suggesting a similar mechanism of action. The presence of both NRP1 and NRP2 in neurons allows for a more complex and fine-tuned regulation of axonal guidance.

In conclusion, the SEMA3F-NRP1/NRP2 interaction plays a critical role in axonal guidance during neuronal development. The binding of SEMA3F to NRP1 and NRP2 receptors on growth cones mediates axon repulsion, ensuring proper axonal pathfinding and the establishment of functional neuronal circuits."	0.4884486	453	0.037088586867529	axon guidance|regulation of axon guidance|anterior/posterior axon guidance|axon extension involved in axon guidance|neuron projection guidance|positive regulation of axon guidance|dorsal/ventral axon guidance|axonogenesis|axonal transport|motor neuron axon guidance	0.96354395|0.85946983|0.8552217|0.8529097|0.8192867|0.8089547|0.8051903|0.8032866|0.79946077|0.79676867	1.0794364445318996e-05|0.0033392051222115643|1.0|4.052860861916853e-08|1.0931001970065525e-05|0.001113895754705455|1.0|6.914144598652871e-05|1.0|2.5611467138626368e-05	3.643667323355175e-05|0.0047702930317308065|1.0|4.052860861916853e-07|3.643667323355175e-05|0.0018564929245090916|1.0|0.00013828289197305742|1.0|6.402866784656591e-05	0.012552301255230125|0.07142857142857142|0.0|0.07894736842105263|0.0125|0.16666666666666666|0.0|0.006772009029345372|0.0|0.06060606060606061	negative regulation of gonadotropin secretion	0.07587826	12151	0.9948419846078271

Circadian rhythms are endogenous, entrainable oscillations of about 24 hours that regulate various physiological processes, including sleep-wake cycles, hormone secretion, and metabolism.

Key proteins involved in circadian rhythm regulation include CLOCK, BMAL1, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1, and CRY2. The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer acts as a positive regulator, binding to E-box elements in the promoters of target genes, including PER and CRY genes. PER and CRY proteins form complexes that translocate to the nucleus and inhibit CLOCK-BMAL1 activity, creating a negative feedback loop.

Several kinases, such as CSNK1D and CSNK1E, phosphorylate PER proteins, leading to their degradation and allowing the cycle to restart. The balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is maintained by phosphatases like PPP1CB, PPP1CA, and PPP1CC.

SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, modulates the activity of CLOCK-BMAL1 by deacetylating BMAL1 and PER2. HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, histone deacetylases, also play roles in circadian regulation by modulating chromatin structure and gene expression.

Nuclear receptors, such as RORA, RORC, NR1D1, and PPARA, are involved in the regulation of BMAL1 and CLOCK expression, adding another layer of regulation to the circadian system. Additionally, proteins like ID1, ID2, ID3, and ID4 act as negative regulators of CLOCK-BMAL1 activity.

Other proteins in this system, such as DRD2, DRD3, MC3R, and LGR4, are involved in signaling pathways that modulate circadian rhythms in response to environmental cues, such as light and food availability.

In summary, this system of interacting proteins plays a crucial role in the regulation of circadian rhythms through a complex network of transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational mechanisms."	0.8971548	3	0.0002456197805796	regulation of circadian rhythm|circadian rhythm|circadian regulation of gene expression|circadian temperature homeostasis|circadian behavior|regulation of circadian sleep/wake cycle|positive regulation of circadian rhythm|entrainment of circadian clock|negative regulation of circadian rhythm|circadian regulation of translation	0.97579646|0.9097515|0.8971548|0.8803676|0.8727532|0.8556826|0.8522881|0.84237164|0.830456|0.8236933	8.482740301301359e-51|2.1372655332451766e-129|3.721889031912453e-187|0.0001316542160748886|1.8979056003511745e-20|1.0083737636207115e-05|1.2539325462322205e-07|5.3615558382418526e-27|2.2157269164341922e-08|1.140592061077026e-06	2.8275801004337865e-50|1.0686327666225882e-128|3.721889031912453e-186|0.0001316542160748886|3.795811200702349e-20|1.1204152929119016e-05|1.7913322089031723e-07|1.340388959560463e-26|3.6928781940569875e-08|1.4257400763462824e-06	0.22151898734177214|0.33962264150943394|1.0|0.0273972602739726|0.1346153846153846|0.0449438202247191|0.05813953488372093|0.17777777777777778|0.06172839506172839|0.0410958904109589	positive regulation of immune effector process	0.1291889	11526	0.943671196987064

Key proteins involved in these processes include RAD51, BRCA1, BRCA2, MRE11, RAD50, NBN, and ATM. These proteins play crucial roles in homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and DNA damage response (DDR).

Homologous recombination (HR) is a major pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). RAD51, BRCA1, and BRCA2 are essential for HR, as they facilitate the search for homologous sequences and promote strand invasion. MRE11, RAD50, and NBN form the MRN complex, which is involved in DSB recognition and end processing. ATM is a key kinase in the DDR, phosphorylating numerous substrates, including H2AX, to initiate repair.

Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is another pathway for repairing DSBs. Key proteins involved in NHEJ include XRCC4, LIG4, and PRKDC. XRCC4 and LIG4 form a complex that ligates broken DNA ends, while PRKDC is a kinase that phosphorylates and activates other NHEJ factors.

DNA replication is a critical process for cell division, and several proteins in this system are involved in the assembly and function of the replicative helicase, including MCM2-7, CDC45, and GINS. These proteins form the CMG complex, which unwinds DNA at replication forks. Other proteins, such as FEN1 and LIG1, are involved in processing and ligating Okazaki fragments during lagging strand synthesis.

This process is crucial for the formation of new blood vessels in response to low oxygen levels, which is essential for tissue repair, wound healing, and tumor growth.

1. Central role of HIF1A and EPAS1: Hypoxia-inducible factors HIF1A and EPAS1 are key transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, such as VEGFA, ANGPT4, and EDN1. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF1A and EPAS1 are stabilized and activate the transcription of these target genes.

2. Regulation of HIF1A and EPAS1 by EGLN1, EGLN2, and EGLN3: The prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins EGLN1, EGLN2, and EGLN3 hydroxylate HIF1A and EPAS1, targeting them for degradation under normoxic conditions. This ensures that angiogenesis is only induced under hypoxic conditions.

3. Involvement of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway: The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which includes proteins such as PIK3CB, AKT1, and MTOR, is involved in the regulation of HIF1A and EPAS1 translation and stability. This pathway also regulates cell survival, proliferation, and migration, which are essential for angiogenesis.

4. Role of PTEN and TSC1: The tumor suppressor proteins PTEN and TSC1 negatively regulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis. Loss of PTEN or TSC1 function can lead to uncontrolled angiogenesis and tumor growth.

5. Involvement of SIRT1 and FOXO1: SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, and FOXO1, a transcription factor, are involved in the regulation of angiogenesis through modulation of HIF1A and EPAS1 activity. SIRT1 can deacetylate HIF1A, leading to its degradation, while FOXO1 can compete with HIF1A for binding to target genes, inhibiting their transcription.

6. Role of VHL in HIF1A degradation: The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL) is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of HIF1A under normoxic conditions. Loss of VHL function can lead to constitutive activation of HIF1A and uncontrolled angiogenesis.

7. Involvement of other proteins in angiogenesis: Several other proteins in this system, such as CD34, CAV1, and AQP1, are involved in various aspects of angiogenesis, including endothelial cell differentiation, migration, and permeability.

In conclusion, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, a critical process for tissue repair, wound healing, and tumor growth. The central players in this process are HIF1A and EPAS1, which are regulated by a complex network of proteins that modulate their stability, translation, and transcriptional activity."	0.46019682	180	0.0147371868347797	angiogenesis|angiogenesis involved in coronary vascular morphogenesis|angiogenesis involved in wound healing|sprouting angiogenesis|blood vessel endothelial cell proliferation involved in sprouting angiogenesis|hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha signaling pathway|intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to hypoxia|positive regulation of angiogenesis|vasculogenesis|regulation of hypoxia-induced intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway	0.6887336|0.65565586|0.6450494|0.6422545|0.6089616|0.6052575|0.5991076|0.59069234|0.5848193|0.5827628	3.532405544977749e-14|1.0|0.0006456386120910288|0.012358941461346407|0.04944616929884339|7.018180065029368e-10|2.9790576224424914e-17|1.922461783990308e-08|0.0001862728419875475|1.0170330609982276e-11	1.7662027724888746e-13|1.0|0.0009223408744157555|0.015448676826683008|0.05494018810982599|1.754545016257342e-09|2.9790576224424914e-16|3.844923567980616e-08|0.0003104547366459125|3.3901102033274255e-11	0.053929121725731895|0.0|0.021739130434782608|0.02120141342756184|0.01092896174863388|0.031055900621118012|0.055900621118012424|0.04854368932038835|0.029914529914529916|0.037267080745341616	pyridine nucleotide catabolic process	0.23494011	9114	0.7461928934010152

Cholesterol homeostasis is crucial for maintaining cellular function and overall health, as cholesterol is a vital component of cell membranes and a precursor for steroid hormones and bile acids.

Key proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis include:

1. HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) - the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Its activity is regulated by SREBF1 and SREBF2, transcription factors that control the expression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake.

2. LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) - responsible for the uptake of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) particles, which transport cholesterol in the bloodstream. Mutations in LDLR can lead to familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

3. ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) - mediates the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid-poor apolipoproteins, such as APOA1, forming nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. This process is essential for reverse cholesterol transport, where excess cholesterol is removed from peripheral tissues and returned to the liver for excretion.

4. CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) - facilitates the exchange of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between HDL and LDL particles. This process modulates the composition and size of lipoprotein particles, influencing their metabolic fate and function.

5. CYP7A1 (cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1) - the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, which converts cholesterol into bile acids. Bile acids are essential for the emulsification and absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins.

6. NPC1 (Niemann-Pick disease, type C1) and NPC2 (Niemann-Pick disease, type C2) - proteins involved in the intracellular trafficking of cholesterol. Mutations in these genes cause Niemann-Pick disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in lysosomes.

7. LRP5 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5) - a co-receptor for Wnt signaling, which has been implicated in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and bile acid synthesis.

In summary, this system of interacting proteins plays a critical role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis by regulating cholesterol synthesis, uptake, transport, and excretion. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to various metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases."	0.36017054	1370	0.1121663664647126	cholesterol homeostasis|sterol homeostasis|cholesterol metabolic process|cholesterol storage|sterol metabolic process|lipid homeostasis|response to cholesterol|cellular response to cholesterol|regulation of cholesterol metabolic process|triglyceride homeostasis	0.9999999|0.8836439|0.8393189|0.74775136|0.74384975|0.73561954|0.73284745|0.73200107|0.7253608|0.7183516	1.3127230816556025e-49|2.3078066761324934e-49|3.1672256876154132e-301|1.2785754355779264e-14|5.631111513991491e-281|5.210717430224094e-44|0.00032847956028045594|0.01707195305813444|5.25128163673625e-68|3.915854786752448e-11	3.281807704139006e-49|4.615613352264987e-49|3.167225687615413e-300|1.826536336539895e-14|2.815555756995745e-280|8.684529050373491e-44|0.0003649772892005066|0.01707195305813444|1.750427212245417e-67|4.89481848344056e-11	0.1958762886597938|0.19487179487179487|0.9315068493150684|0.06451612903225806|0.84472049689441|0.16091954022988506|0.023952095808383235|0.012578616352201259|0.23972602739726026|0.057803468208092484	positive regulation of mitochondrial depolarization	0.10305605	11805	0.9665138365809727

This process is crucial for embryonic development, cell differentiation, and tissue patterning.

1. Central role of SHH: SHH is a secreted protein that acts as a morphogen, regulating the expression of target genes in a concentration-dependent manner. It is involved in the patterning of the neural tube, limb development, and organogenesis.

2. GLI transcription factors: GLI2 and GLI3 are zinc-finger transcription factors that mediate SHH signaling. In the absence of SHH, GLI3 is proteolytically processed into a repressor form, inhibiting target gene expression. Upon SHH binding to its receptor PTCH1, this repression is relieved, allowing GLI2 and GLI3 to activate target genes.

3. PTCH1 and SUFU: PTCH1 is a transmembrane protein that acts as the receptor for SHH. In the absence of SHH, PTCH1 inhibits the activity of Smoothened (SMO), a protein required for GLI activation. SUFU is a negative regulator of the pathway, sequestering GLI proteins in the cytoplasm and preventing their nuclear translocation.

4. Intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins: IFT172 and DYNC2H1 are components of the IFT complex, which is essential for ciliogenesis and ciliary function. Primary cilia are critical for SHH signal transduction, as they facilitate the processing and activation of GLI proteins.

5. Transcription factors involved in neural development: Several transcription factors in this system, such as PAX6, ASCL1, OLIG2, OLIG3, and ISL1, are involved in the specification and differentiation of neural cell types. SHH signaling plays a crucial role in determining the fate of these cells during development.

This conclusion is based on the presence of several proteins that are directly involved in the NF-κB pathway, including NFKBIA, NFKBIB, and NFKBIE, as well as proteins that interact with or modulate the activity of NF-κB, such as PKD1, PKD2, and KEAP1.

1. Inhibition of NF-κB signaling by IκB proteins: NFKBIA, NFKBIB, and NFKBIE are members of the IκB family of proteins, which function as inhibitors of NF-κB transcription factors. These proteins sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm, preventing its nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of target genes. The presence of multiple IκB proteins in this system suggests a central role in regulating NF-κB signaling.

2. Modulation of NF-κB activity by PKD1 and PKD2: PKD1 and PKD2 are members of the protein kinase D family, which have been shown to modulate NF-κB activity. PKD1 can activate the NF-κB pathway by phosphorylating IκB proteins, leading to their degradation and release of NF-κB. PKD2 has also been reported to regulate NF-κB signaling, although its precise mechanism of action remains unclear.

3. Regulation of NF-κB by KEAP1: KEAP1 is a negative regulator of the transcription factor Nrf2, which is involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress. KEAP1 has been shown to interact with the NF-κB subunit p65, inhibiting its transcriptional activity. This interaction suggests a potential crosstalk between the NF-κB and Nrf2 pathways in this system.

4. Involvement of other proteins in NF-κB regulation: Several other proteins in this system have been reported to interact with or modulate NF-κB signaling. For example, FLNA has been shown to interact with the NF-κB subunit p65, potentially affecting its activity. G3BP2 has been implicated in the regulation of NF-κB signaling in response to DNA damage, while SUFU is a negative regulator of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which can modulate NF-κB activity.

In summary, the presence of multiple proteins involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling, as well as proteins that interact with or modulate the activity of NF-κB, suggests that the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of NF-κB signaling."	0.2548952	3444	0.2819715081054527	regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling|regulation of NIK/NF-kappaB signaling|I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling|positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling|regulation of I-kappaB phosphorylation|regulation of tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway|NIK/NF-kappaB signaling|regulation of toll-like receptor 9 signaling pathway|negative regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling|negative regulation of NIK/NF-kappaB signaling	0.8122418|0.78646445|0.7501323|0.7124499|0.71210974|0.70702064|0.7016849|0.69769293|0.6827488|0.6538469	0.012196296947581144|0.01597949048840128|0.001962023366687256|0.051711790091853505|1.0|1.0|0.02502796684682247|1.0|0.08783061388160812|0.05324798413096692	0.053264968294670936|0.053264968294670936|0.019620233666872558|0.0887466402182782|1.0|1.0|0.06256991711705617|1.0|0.12547230554515446|0.0887466402182782	0.011152416356877323|0.01680672268907563|0.013333333333333334|0.009615384615384616|0.0|0.0|0.0136986301369863|0.0|0.014925373134328358|0.020833333333333332	regulation of microvillus length	0.26299876	3071	0.2514327820533814

GO:1900060	PRKAA1 ORMDL2 ORMDL3 ORMDL1 SPHK1	5	negative regulation of ceramide biosynthetic process	Sphingolipid Metabolism Regulation	"The primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism. This conclusion is based on the following observations:

1. ORMDL family proteins (ORMDL1, ORMDL2, and ORMDL3) are known to be involved in the regulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis. They act as negative regulators of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid synthesis. By inhibiting SPT, ORMDL proteins help maintain cellular sphingolipid homeostasis.

2. PRKAA1, also known as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) catalytic subunit alpha-1, is a key energy sensor and regulator of cellular metabolism. AMPK activation has been shown to inhibit sphingolipid synthesis by phosphorylating and activating ORMDL3, which in turn inhibits SPT activity. This suggests a functional link between PRKAA1 and the ORMDL family proteins in the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism.

3. SPHK1, or sphingosine kinase 1, is an enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to form sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is a bioactive lipid mediator involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, survival, and migration. The activity of SPHK1 is known to be regulated by various factors, including AMPK. PRKAA1-mediated phosphorylation of SPHK1 has been reported to inhibit its activity, further supporting the role of this protein system in sphingolipid metabolism regulation.

In summary, the interaction between PRKAA1, ORMDL family proteins, and SPHK1 suggests a coordinated regulation of sphingolipid metabolism, with PRKAA1 acting as a central regulator. This system may play a crucial role in maintaining cellular sphingolipid homeostasis and responding to changes in cellular energy status."	0.46637195	533	0.0436384476829867	regulation of sphingolipid biosynthetic process|sphingolipid metabolic process|regulation of sphingolipid mediated signaling pathway|cellular sphingolipid homeostasis|sphingoid metabolic process|sphingomyelin metabolic process|sphingosine metabolic process|sphinganine metabolic process|glycosphingolipid metabolic process|regulation of ceramide biosynthetic process	0.85801107|0.85081536|0.84702545|0.8162769|0.7955294|0.76467746|0.76132494|0.7552592|0.7441322|0.7353867	1.0668038571628286e-15|7.241688984244536e-10|1.0|4.802906186118955e-10|0.01063426632125844|3.265426086714145e-05|0.009713154988911754|1.0|0.028005564296934227|6.56494681338201e-16	5.334019285814143e-15|1.810422246061134e-09|1.0|1.6009687287063183e-09|0.0151918090303692|6.53085217342829e-05|0.0151918090303692|1.0|0.03500695537116778|5.334019285814143e-15	0.38461538461538464|0.030864197530864196|0.0|0.42857142857142855|0.037037037037037035|0.08695652173913043|0.04|0.0|0.015384615384615385|0.4166666666666667	negative regulation of defense response	0.27310616	5797	0.4746192893401015

GO:0060769	CTNNB1 AR SHH	3	positive regulation of epithelial cell proliferation involved in prostate gland development	Androgen-mediated Wnt/β-catenin Signaling	"CTNNB1, also known as β-catenin, is a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. It plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and gene transcription regulation. In the absence of Wnt ligands, β-catenin is phosphorylated and targeted for degradation. Upon Wnt ligand binding, β-catenin is stabilized and translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to regulate target gene expression.

AR, or androgen receptor, is a nuclear receptor that binds to androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. Upon ligand binding, AR undergoes conformational changes and translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of target genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival.

SHH, or Sonic Hedgehog, is a secreted protein that plays a critical role in embryonic development and tissue patterning. It functions through the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue morphogenesis.

The interaction between CTNNB1 and AR suggests a crosstalk between the Wnt/β-catenin and androgen signaling pathways. This crosstalk has been reported in various biological contexts, including prostate cancer, where androgens can activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote cell growth and survival. The involvement of SHH in this system implies a potential role in modulating the Wnt/β-catenin and androgen signaling pathways during development and tissue patterning.

In summary, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is androgen-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This process involves the crosstalk between the Wnt/β-catenin and androgen signaling pathways, which can regulate cell growth, differentiation, and survival. The presence of SHH in this system suggests a potential role in modulating these pathways during development and tissue patterning."	0.44031823	272	0.022269526772556	androgen receptor signaling pathway|canonical Wnt signaling pathway|non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway|beta-catenin-TCF complex assembly|regulation of androgen receptor signaling pathway|Wnt signaling pathway|epithelial-mesenchymal signaling involved in prostate gland development|Wnt signaling pathway, calcium modulating pathway|non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway via JNK cascade|cell-cell signaling by wnt	0.71415025|0.6594282|0.6493468|0.6401802|0.62898237|0.62513137|0.625025|0.60460377|0.60321265|0.5971409	0.013036077498429955|0.0022324053523269925|1.0|1.0|1.0|0.004839014067219658|0.0005570513319428632|1.0|1.0|0.004882634831856001	0.02607215499685991|0.011162026761634962|1.0|1.0|1.0|0.012206587079640003|0.005570513319428632|1.0|1.0|0.012206587079640003	0.02040816326530612|0.006711409395973154|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.004545454545454545|0.25|0.0|0.0|0.004524886877828055	glycosaminoglycan metabolic process	0.25247878	6687	0.5474864909120681

The proteins involved in this process include BCL2, BAX, XIAP, AKT3, and NOTCH1.

1. BCL2 and BAX: These proteins play a crucial role in regulating apoptosis by controlling the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. BCL2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that prevents the release of cytochrome c, while BAX is a pro-apoptotic protein that promotes cytochrome c release, leading to caspase activation and cell death. The balance between these proteins determines the cell's fate.

2. XIAP: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is a potent inhibitor of caspases, which are the primary executioners of apoptosis. By inhibiting caspases, XIAP prevents the activation of the apoptotic cascade and promotes cell survival.

3. AKT3: AKT3 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in cell survival and proliferation. It is involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which promotes cell growth and inhibits apoptosis by phosphorylating and inactivating pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAD and caspase-9.

4. NOTCH1: NOTCH1 is a transmembrane receptor involved in cell fate determination and differentiation. Upon activation, NOTCH1 can promote cell survival by upregulating the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL2 and downregulating pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX.
