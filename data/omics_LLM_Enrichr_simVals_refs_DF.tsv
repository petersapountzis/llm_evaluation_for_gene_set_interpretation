SLC39A4, also known as ZIP4, is a zinc transporter protein that plays a critical role in the absorption of zinc from the dietary tract into the bloodstream. It is predominantly expressed in the small intestine and is essential for maintaining systemic zinc levels. Mutations in SLC39A4 can lead to acrodermatitis enteropathica, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by zinc deficiency.

2. ITPR3, or Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3, is an intracellular channel that mediates the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm, thus contributing to the regulation of intracellular calcium signaling. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Calcium signaling can also influence immune responses and is implicated in the activation and regulation of immune cells.

3. PSMB9, known as the β1i subunit, is a component of the immunoproteasome, which is an alternative form of the proteasome present in immune cells. The immunoproteasome is involved in the generation of antigenic peptides presented by MHC class I molecules, which is crucial for the immune surveillance and response to pathogens and abnormal cells. PSMB9 is induced by interferon-gamma and plays a role in antigen processing during immune responses.

In summary, the proteins in this system are involved in maintaining zinc homeostasis, which is vital for numerous biological processes, including immune function. The system also modulates immune responses through calcium signaling and antigen processing. The interplay between zinc transport, calcium signaling, and the immunoproteasome suggests a coordinated role in the regulation of cellular and systemic responses to maintain homeostasis and defend against pathogens."	0.85	0.0	2/77	4.378034510024077e-05	0.0006129248314033	ITPR3;SLC39A4	Monoatomic Cation Homeostasis 	GO:0055080	0	0.28619853	0.21458697	Neither	"1.

1	1	1	1	1	0	Disease	C0002448	Ameloblastoma	BRAF SMO	2	Hedgehog Signaling and MAPK Pathway Modulation	"1. BRAF is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a significant role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for cell division, differentiation, and secretion. Mutations in BRAF are implicated in various cancers, as they can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. BRAF acts downstream of RAS proteins and is a key player in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, affecting gene expression.

2. SMO, or Smoothened, is a G protein-coupled receptor that is a central component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for embryonic development and, in adults, plays a role in tissue regeneration and stem cell maintenance. Aberrant activation of the Hh pathway can also lead to tumorigenesis. SMO is regulated by the Hh ligand, and upon activation, it initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of GLI transcription factors.

The interaction between BRAF and SMO suggests a cross-talk between the MAPK/ERK pathway and the Hedgehog signaling pathway. This cross-talk can have significant implications for cell fate decisions and proliferation. The integration of these pathways can lead to a nuanced control of cellular processes, but can also contribute to the complexity of oncogenic signaling networks.

In summary, the proteins BRAF and SMO are involved in two distinct but potentially interacting signaling pathways that are critical for cell growth, differentiation, and development. The Hedgehog pathway, mediated by SMO, and the MAPK/ERK pathway, involving BRAF, are both highly influential in determining cell fate and can have synergistic or antagonistic interactions depending on the cellular context. The prominence of these pathways in development and disease makes them key targets for therapeutic intervention."	0.85	0.0	2/364	0.0003303363972881	0.0068181438587893	SMO;BRAF	Positive Regulation Of Macromolecule Metabolic Process 	GO:0010604	0	0.18512395	0.064167015	Neither	"1.

CDKN2A, also known as p16^INK4a, is a tumor suppressor protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of the cell cycle. It inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6, halting cell cycle progression at the G1 phase. This protein is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide range of cancers, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation.

2. ELF3 is an ETS-domain transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is implicated in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process often associated with cancer metastasis. ELF3 can act as an oncogene in certain contexts, promoting tumor growth and progression.

3. ERBB2, also known as HER2/neu, is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, when overexpressed or amplified, leads to the activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways that drive cell proliferation, survival, and migration. ERBB2 is a well-known oncogene in breast cancer and other malignancies.

4. IDH1 and IDH2 are isocitrate dehydrogenases that normally function in the citric acid cycle. Mutations in these enzymes are common in several types of cancer and result in the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). This metabolite can inhibit DNA and histone demethylases, leading to epigenetic alterations that support tumorigenesis.

5. PRKACB is a catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including metabolism, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Aberrant PKA signaling can contribute to cancer by altering the phosphorylation status of key proteins involved in growth control and by modulating the tumor microenvironment.

In summary, the proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and metabolic reprogramming, two hallmarks of cancer. The interplay between tumor suppressors like CDKN2A and oncogenes such as ERBB2 and ELF3 can dictate the balance between normal cellular function and malignant transformation. The metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, when mutated, contribute to the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells, while PRKACB's role in PKA signaling can influence various aspects of cancer biology.

CMKLR1 and its ligand RARRES2 are part of a signaling pathway that influences adipocyte activity and the immune response in adipose tissue. LEPR is central to the leptin signaling pathway, which informs the central nervous system about the body's energy status and helps regulate energy intake and expenditure. The interplay between these proteins is critical for maintaining energy homeostasis and has implications for metabolic health, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. The chosen process name reflects the primary function of these proteins in adipokine signaling and the regulation of energy balance within the organism.

KHDC3L, also known as C6orf221, is a maternal-effect protein that is required for the maintenance of genomic imprinting during oocyte growth. It is implicated in the protection of maternal imprints in oocytes and is essential for female fertility. KHDC3L mutations are associated with recurrent hydatidiform moles (HYDM1), a gestational trophoblastic disease characterized by abnormal early pregnancy development.

2. NLRP7, a member of the NLR family, is involved in the immune response and inflammation, but it also plays a role in reproductive processes. Mutations in NLRP7 are linked to familial recurrent hydatidiform mole (HYDM2), which, like HYDM1, involves aberrant embryonic development. NLRP7 is thought to be involved in the regulation of genomic imprinting and inflammation during early embryogenesis.

Both KHDC3L and NLRP7 are implicated in the proper establishment and maintenance of genomic imprinting, which is crucial for normal embryonic development. Their interaction suggests a coordinated role in ensuring the correct epigenetic regulation is passed on during early stages of human development. Given the association of both proteins with similar reproductive disorders, their interaction likely reflects a shared pathway or mechanism that, when disrupted, leads to abnormal pregnancy outcomes.

16	16	16	16	16	0	Disease	C0023532	Leukoplakia, Oral	PTGS2 RHBDF2	2	Prostaglandin Synthesis and Inflammatory Response Modulation	"1. PTGS2, also known as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor for various prostaglandins and thromboxanes. These lipid compounds are involved in mediating inflammatory responses, pain, fever, and also play roles in angiogenesis, vasodilation, and thrombosis. PTGS2 is inducible and is typically upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, growth factors, and tumor promoters.

2. RHBDF2, also known as iRhom2, is a regulatory protein that modulates the trafficking and proteolytic activation of membrane-bound precursors of growth factors and cytokines, such as TNF-alpha. It is implicated in the regulation of inflammatory signaling pathways and has been associated with the control of EGFR signaling through the release of AREG (amphiregulin).

The interaction between PTGS2 and RHBDF2 suggests a coordinated role in the modulation of inflammatory responses. PTGS2 is directly involved in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators, while RHBDF2 may influence the availability and activity of growth factors and cytokines that can modulate the intensity and duration of inflammation.

PTGS2, also known as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor for various prostaglandins and thromboxanes. These lipid compounds are involved in mediating inflammatory responses, pain, fever, and also play roles in angiogenesis, vasodilation, and thrombosis. PTGS2 is inducible and is typically upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, growth factors, and tumor promoters.

2. RHBDF2, also known as iRhom2, is a regulatory protein that modulates the trafficking and proteolytic activation of membrane-bound precursors of growth factors and cytokines, such as TNF-alpha. It is implicated in the regulation of inflammatory signaling pathways and has been associated with the control of EGFR signaling through the release of AREG (amphiregulin).[1][2]

The interaction between PTGS2 and RHBDF2 suggests a coordinated role in the modulation of inflammatory responses. PTGS2 is directly involved in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators, while RHBDF2 may influence the availability and activity of growth factors and cytokines that can modulate the intensity and duration of inflammation.

SIL1 is a nucleotide exchange factor that is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It acts as a co-chaperone for the ER resident chaperone BiP/GRP78, which is involved in protein folding and the ER stress response. SIL1 deficiency can lead to an accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, triggering the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR aims to restore normal function by halting protein translation, degrading misfolded proteins, and activating signaling pathways that lead to increased production of molecular chaperones.

2. INPP5K, also known as SKIP, is a phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase that is involved in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway. It specifically hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (IP2) and diacylglycerol (DAG). This action is important for the regulation of various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and insulin signaling. INPP5K has been implicated in the regulation of insulin receptor signaling by modulating the phosphoinositide composition of the plasma membrane.

The interaction between SIL1 and INPP5K suggests a functional link between ER stress response and phosphoinositide signaling. While SIL1 is directly involved in the management of ER stress and protein folding, INPP5K's role in phosphoinositide signaling could influence downstream effects on ER function, as phosphoinositides are known to play a role in membrane dynamics and trafficking within the ER and Golgi apparatus. The interplay between these proteins may be critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis under conditions that affect ER function and membrane composition.

The system also includes proteins like INSR (insulin receptor) and GRIA4 (glutamate receptor, ionotropic, AMPA 4), which are involved in cellular signaling pathways that can impact neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and metabolic regulation, further influencing neurotransmission and neuromodulation.

6. Additional proteins such as CD274 (programmed death-ligand 1) and PRKCE (protein kinase C epsilon) are part of signaling cascades that can modulate immune responses and synaptic plasticity, respectively, indicating a broader regulatory role in the nervous system.

In summary, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the complex processes of neurotransmission and neuromodulation.

It also plays a role in intracellular signaling and is important for the proper functioning of cardiac and skeletal muscle.

3. PLN, or phospholamban, is a regulatory protein that inhibits the activity of SERCA2. By modulating SERCA2 activity, PLN controls the uptake of Ca2+ into the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum and thus regulates calcium homeostasis, which is crucial for muscle contraction and relaxation cycles, as well as signaling within cells.

4. TNF, or tumor necrosis factor, is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in inflammation and the acute phase response. TNF is involved in the regulation of a wide spectrum of biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and coagulation. It is also one of the cytokines that can induce the expression of NOS2, linking it to the production of NO during inflammatory responses.

In summary, the proteins in this system interact to regulate the balance between nitric oxide production and calcium homeostasis, particularly in the context of inflammatory responses. NOS2 and TNF are directly involved in the inflammatory process, with TNF inducing the expression of NOS2 and thus increasing NO production. ATP2A2 and PLN, on the other hand, are key regulators of calcium signaling, which is a critical secondary messenger in many cellular processes, including those involved in muscle contraction and inflammatory responses. The interplay between these proteins suggests a coordinated response to inflammation that involves both the regulation of nitric oxide synthesis and the modulation of calcium-dependent processes."	0.85	0.0	2/26	9.734272886653031e-06	0.0030990483174253	PLN;ATP2A2	Regulation Of Cardiac Muscle Cell Contraction 	GO:0086004	0	0.32028222	0.39657176	Neither

34	34	34	34	34	0	Disease	C0220702	SCHIZOPHRENIA 1 (disorder)	TSNAX-DISC1 TDO2	2	Regulation of Neurodevelopment and Kynurenine Pathway Modulation	"1. TSNAX-DISC1 is a protein complex formed by the interactor proteins TSNAX (Translin-Associated Factor X) and DISC1 (Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1). DISC1 is a scaffold protein implicated in neurodevelopment, particularly in the regulation of neuronal migration and axonal outgrowth. It has been associated with various psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and depression. DISC1 interacts with multiple proteins involved in neural signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics, suggesting a role in the structural and functional organization of synapses.

2. TDO2 (Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of tryptophan degradation along the kynurenine pathway. This pathway is significant in neurobiology as it leads to the production of metabolites that can influence neuroplasticity, neurodegeneration, and immune response in the central nervous system. TDO2 activity has been linked to the modulation of serotonin levels and the production of neuroactive kynurenine pathway metabolites, which can have neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects depending on their concentrations and the presence of stressors.

The interaction between TSNAX-DISC1 and TDO2 suggests a system that integrates neurodevelopmental processes with the regulation of the kynurenine pathway. The TSNAX-DISC1 complex may influence neuronal function and connectivity, potentially affecting the availability of tryptophan and the activity of TDO2. This could have implications for synaptic plasticity and resilience to psychiatric disorders. The proteins in this system appear to be functionally integrated, with TSNAX-DISC1 potentially modulating the impact of TDO2 on the neural environment.

In conclusion, the TSNAX-DISC1 and TDO2 interaction represents a convergence of neurodevelopmental regulation and control of tryptophan metabolism, which could be critical in maintaining neural function and responding to environmental stressors. The proteins in this system are not only involved in distinct biological processes but also likely interact to modulate each other's effects on the brain and behavior."	0.85	0.0	1/7	0.0006998773712248	0.0023995217514245	TDO2	Tryptophan Catabolic Process 	GO:0006569	0	0.22509956	0.26692754	Neither	"1.

TPP2, or tripeptidyl peptidase II, is a serine protease involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. It plays a role in the immune system by contributing to the processing of antigenic peptides that are presented on MHC class I molecules. This is crucial for the immune surveillance by cytotoxic T cells. TPP2 also has non-immunological functions, including roles in cell growth and apoptosis, which can indirectly influence immune and inflammatory responses.

2. ADA2, or adenosine deaminase 2, is an enzyme that catalyzes the deamination of adenosine, converting it to inosine. It is involved in purine metabolism and has a role in modulating the immune response. ADA2 deficiency is associated with an inflammatory condition known as ADA2 deficiency (DADA2), which can lead to vasculitis and other immune dysregulation symptoms. ADA2 also has a role in the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages and dendritic cells, which are key players in the immune system.

Together, TPP2 and ADA2 are involved in the modulation of immune and inflammatory responses. TPP2's role in antigen processing is critical for the adaptive immune response, while ADA2's involvement in purine metabolism and immune cell differentiation affects both innate and adaptive immunity.

SCN5A encodes a protein that is critical for the initiation and propagation of cardiac action potentials. It forms the alpha subunit of the cardiac sodium channel, which is responsible for the fast influx of Na+ ions during the phase 0 depolarization of the cardiac myocytes. Mutations in SCN5A are associated with a variety of cardiac arrhythmias, including Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and atrial fibrillation, highlighting its central role in cardiac electrophysiology.

2. DPP6 is an auxiliary subunit for potassium channels, which modulates the function of the primary channel-forming subunits. It affects the activation and inactivation kinetics of the A-type potassium current, which is important for repolarization of the action potential and for setting the excitability of neurons and cardiac cells. DPP6, therefore, plays a role in the fine-tuning of cardiac action potentials and the prevention of arrhythmogenic afterdepolarizations.

3. KCNE5 is a potassium channel accessory subunit that associates with the voltage-gated potassium channel complex. It modulates the function of the KCNQ1 channel, which is essential for the cardiac slow delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs). This current is crucial for the phase 3 repolarization of the cardiac action potential. KCNE5's influence on KCNQ1 can affect the duration of the action potential and, consequently, the QT interval on the electrocardiogram.

4. KCNQ1 encodes the alpha subunit of a voltage-gated potassium channel that is essential for the cardiac IKs current. This current contributes to the repolarization of the cardiac action potential and helps to determine the heart's refractory period. Mutations in KCNQ1 can lead to Long QT syndrome, which is characterized by prolonged repolarization and a predisposition to life-threatening arrhythmias.

In summary, the proteins in this system work in concert to regulate the cardiac action potential, particularly its initiation, propagation, and repolarization. The interplay between these proteins ensures the proper timing and coordination of electrical signals across the heart, which is essential for maintaining a regular rhythm and preventing arrhythmias.

EWSR1 (Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1) is a protein that plays a role in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing. It is known to interact with various transcription factors and has been implicated in DNA repair processes. EWSR1's involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests a potential modulatory role in the expression of genes downstream of signaling pathways.

2. HEY1 (Hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein 1) and HES1 (Hairy and enhancer of split 1) are transcriptional repressors in the Notch signaling pathway. They are involved in the regulation of differentiation and proliferation processes. Both proteins are known to be critical for the maintenance of stem cell populations and the determination of cell fate.

3. NOTCH2 is a member of the Notch family of receptors, which are involved in a highly conserved cell signaling pathway that regulates cell fate determination, stem cell maintenance, and differentiation in various tissues. Upon ligand binding, NOTCH2 undergoes proteolytic cleavage, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that translocates to the nucleus and influences gene expression.

4. PMS2 (Postmeiotic segregation increased 2) is a DNA mismatch repair protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by correcting DNA replication errors. It forms a heterodimer with MLH1 to repair base-base mismatches and insertion-deletion loops.

5. PON1 (Paraoxonase 1) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes organophosphates and has antioxidant properties. It is associated with the prevention of oxidative stress, which can lead to DNA damage, and thus may indirectly contribute to the maintenance of genomic integrity.

6. PTCH1 (Patched 1) and SMO (Smoothened) are components of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. PTCH1 is the receptor for Hedgehog ligands, and in the absence of ligand, it represses the activity of SMO. Upon ligand binding, PTCH1 releases SMO, allowing it to propagate the signal downstream, affecting cell proliferation and differentiation.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are involved in two main biological processes: the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell fate determination and tissue development, and DNA repair mechanisms, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability.

ERCC6, also known as Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB), is involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). It plays a critical role in the recognition of DNA lesions and the recruitment of other NER proteins to the damaged site. ERCC6 is particularly important for the repair of lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes.

2. ERCC8, also known as Cockayne syndrome protein A (CSA), is another key component of the TC-NER pathway. It functions in the early stages of NER, participating in the recognition of DNA damage and stabilizing the initiation complex that includes RNA polymerase II and other NER factors. Mutations in ERCC8 are associated with defects in the repair of transcription-blocking lesions.

It is responsible for the transport of iron from enterocytes, hepatocytes, and macrophages into the plasma. The activity of SLC40A1 is regulated by hepcidin, a liver-derived hormone that binds to ferroportin, leading to its internalization and degradation, thus controlling iron efflux.

The interaction between CP and SLC40A1 is central to the maintenance of systemic iron homeostasis. Ceruloplasmin facilitates the oxidation of iron that is necessary for its binding to transferrin after being exported from cells by SLC40A1.

NGF, or Nerve Growth Factor, is a neurotrophin critical for the survival and maintenance of sympathetic and sensory neurons. It plays a significant role in the development and differentiation of neurons during embryogenesis and is also involved in the regeneration and plasticity of neuronal circuits in the adult. NGF is known to be upregulated in inflammatory conditions and contributes to the sensitization of pain pathways.

2. TRPA1, or Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1, is a member of the TRP channel family and functions as an ion channel on the plasma membrane of many cell types, including sensory neurons. It is activated by a wide range of chemical irritants and can be sensitized by inflammatory signals, leading to the perception of pain and neurogenic inflammation. TRPA1 is implicated in the transduction of noxious stimuli and is a target for the development of new analgesics.

3. ADCYAP1, also known as Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide (PACAP), is a neuropeptide that has widespread effects, including modulation of neurotransmitter release, activation of adenylate cyclase, and regulation of cell proliferation. In the context of pain and inflammation, PACAP acts as a neuromodulator and vasodilator, and it has been shown to have both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects depending on the context.

4. EDN1, or Endothelin-1, is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide produced by endothelial cells. It has a role in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure. In addition to its vasoactive properties, EDN1 is involved in pain perception. It can be released in response to injury and inflammation and can induce pain by acting directly on nociceptors or by promoting the release of other pro-inflammatory and algogenic substances.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in the modulation of pain and the inflammatory response, particularly neurogenic inflammation. NGF and TRPA1 are directly implicated in the sensitization and perception of pain, while ADCYAP1 and EDN1 have modulatory roles in inflammation and pain, with effects on vascular dynamics and neuronal activity.

63	63	63	63	63	0	Disease	C1833561	UV-Sensitive Syndrome	UVSSA ERCC6 ERCC8	3	Nucleotide Excision Repair and Transcription-Coupled DNA Damage Response	"1. UVSSA (UV-Stimulated Scaffold Protein A) is a component of the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway. It is involved in the recognition and repair of UV-induced DNA damage, particularly in actively transcribed genes. UVSSA interacts with the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) machinery and stabilizes the stalled RNAPII at sites of DNA damage, facilitating recruitment of repair proteins.

2. ERCC6 (Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 6), also known as Cockayne syndrome B protein (CSB), is another key player in TC-NER. It is involved in the repair of DNA lesions by remodeling the DNA around the damage and recruiting other repair factors. ERCC6 also plays a role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation under stress conditions.

3. ERCC8 (Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 8), also known as Cockayne syndrome A protein (CSA), is essential for initiating TC-NER by recognizing stalled RNAPII and recruiting the ubiquitin ligase complex, which in turn recruits ERCC6. ERCC8 is also implicated in the repair of oxidative DNA damage and in the regulation of transcription in response to DNA damage.

The proteins UVSSA, ERCC6, and ERCC8 work in concert to maintain genomic stability by repairing DNA damage that occurs during transcription. This system is crucial for the rapid repair of transcription-blocking lesions, thereby preventing mutations and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

It is involved in the recognition and repair of UV-induced DNA damage, particularly in actively transcribed genes. UVSSA interacts with the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) machinery and stabilizes the stalled RNAPII at sites of DNA damage, facilitating recruitment of repair proteins.[1]

2. ERCC6 (Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 6), also known as Cockayne syndrome B protein (CSB), is another key player in TC-NER. It is involved in the repair of DNA lesions by remodeling the DNA around the damage and recruiting other repair factors. ERCC6 also plays a role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation under stress conditions.

3. ERCC8 (Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 8), also known as Cockayne syndrome A protein (CSA), is essential for initiating TC-NER by recognizing stalled RNAPII and recruiting the ubiquitin ligase complex, which in turn recruits ERCC6. ERCC8 is also implicated in the repair of oxidative DNA damage and in the regulation of transcription in response to DNA damage.[2]

The proteins UVSSA, ERCC6, and ERCC8 work in concert to maintain genomic stability by repairing DNA damage that occurs during transcription. This system is crucial for the rapid repair of transcription-blocking lesions, thereby preventing mutations and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The interplay between these proteins ensures that transcription can resume promptly after damage is cleared, highlighting their synergistic role in the TC-NER pathway and the broader transcription-coupled DNA damage response.[3]

The majority of the proteins listed are directly involved in the mevalonate pathway, which is the key pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis. HMGCS1 and HMGCR are critical enzymes that catalyze the early rate-limiting steps in this pathway. HMGCS1 condenses acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA, while HMGCR reduces HMG-CoA to mevalonate.

2. Following the mevalonate pathway, several enzymes work sequentially to produce cholesterol. These include IDI1, which synthesizes isopentenyl pyrophosphate, a building block for cholesterol, and FDFT1, which catalyzes the first committed step in cholesterol synthesis from squalene. SQLE, DHCR24, DHCR7, and TM7SF2 are all involved in later stages of cholesterol synthesis, converting squalene into cholesterol through a series of reactions.

3. FASN and ELOVL6 are key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis and elongation, respectively. FASN catalyzes the synthesis of palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, while ELOVL6 is involved in the elongation of long-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids.

5. ACAT2 and ACLY are involved in the metabolism of cholesterol and fatty acids. ACAT2 esterifies cholesterol for storage or transport, while ACLY is a cytosolic enzyme that converts citrate to acetyl-CoA, a precursor for both cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis.

6. Proteins such as CYP51A1, MSMO1, and TMEM97 are involved in sterol metabolism. CYP51A1 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyzes an essential step in sterol biosynthesis, while MSMO1 is involved in sterol biosynthesis as well, specifically in the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol. TMEM97 interacts with sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and is implicated in cholesterol homeostasis.

7. SLC25A1, SLC9A3R1, and SLC40A1 are transport proteins that facilitate the movement of molecules across membranes. SLC25A1 is a citrate transporter, which is important for providing cytosolic acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis. SLC9A3R1 regulates ion transport and pH balance, indirectly affecting cellular metabolism. SLC40A1 is involved in iron transport, which is essential for various metabolic processes.

8. TFRC is a transferrin receptor that is critical for iron uptake, which is necessary for many cellular processes, including the synthesis of heme-containing proteins that are part of the electron transport chain.

9. The presence of enzymes such as FDPS, MVD, and MMAB indicates involvement in isoprenoid and coenzyme synthesis, which are important for the post-translational modification of proteins and for mitochondrial metabolism.

10. INSIG1 is a regulatory protein that mediates feedback control of cholesterol synthesis by binding to sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs).

11. ABHD2, FADS1, and CITED2 are involved in lipid signaling and regulation. ABHD2 is an enzyme with hydrolase activity, FADS1 is involved in the desaturation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and CITED2 is a transcriptional regulator that can influence lipid metabolism.

HIST1H2BJ, HIST1H4H, HIST1H2AC, HIST1H2BC, HIST3H2A, HIST1H2AG, HIST1H2BN, and HIST1H2BH are all core histone proteins. These proteins form the nucleosome, which is the fundamental unit of chromatin. Histones are responsible for the packaging of DNA into structural units, thereby controlling the accessibility of the DNA to various DNA-binding proteins involved in replication, transcription, and repair. Histones can undergo post-translational modifications, such as methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation, which serve as signals for the recruitment of other proteins that regulate chromatin function and gene expression.

2. HIST1H1C is a linker histone, which binds to the nucleosome at the entry and exit sites of the DNA, stabilizing the chromatin structure. It plays a role in the higher-order folding of chromatin and contributes to the regulation of gene expression by making certain regions of the genome more or less accessible to transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins.

3. LINC00958 is a long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA). LincRNAs are known to participate in the regulation of gene expression at various levels, including chromatin modification, transcription, and post-transcriptional processing. They can interact with chromatin-modifying complexes and recruit them to specific genomic loci, thereby influencing the chromatin state and gene expression patterns.

4. HELLPAR is not a well-characterized protein, and its function is not clearly defined in the context of chromatin structure and function. However, given the context of the other proteins in this system, it may be hypothesized that HELLPAR could interact with histones or chromatin remodeling complexes, potentially playing a role in chromatin dynamics or signaling.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this set are directly involved in the formation and modification of chromatin structure, which is essential for the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genomic integrity. The presence of a lincRNA suggests additional layers of regulation at the level of chromatin organization and gene expression. The system of interacting proteins appears to be highly integrated in the processes of chromatin assembly, modification, and overall nuclear architecture, which are critical for proper cellular function."	0.98	1.0	0	1.0	1.0				0	0.6557827	0.40767723	LLM	"1.

Several proteins in this system, such as ACSL3, ELOVL5, FADS1, and SCD, are directly involved in lipid metabolism. ACSL3 activates long-chain fatty acids for both synthesis of cellular lipids and degradation via beta-oxidation. ELOVL5 and FADS1 are involved in the elongation and desaturation of fatty acids, respectively, which are critical steps in the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. SCD is a key enzyme in the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids.

2. Proteins like DHCR24, HMGCR, and HMGCS1 are crucial for cholesterol biosynthesis. DHCR24 catalyzes the reduction of desmosterol to cholesterol. HMGCR is the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. HMGCS1 is also part of this pathway, catalyzing the condensation of acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA.

3. IDI1, INSIG1, and SQLE are also part of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. IDI1 is an isomerase that plays a role in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, including cholesterol. INSIG1 is a regulatory protein that controls the cholesterol synthesis pathway by mediating the degradation of HMGCR. SQLE is another enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, catalyzing a later step in the conversion of squalene into cholesterol.

4. Several proteins, such as ABCC4 and SLC26A2, are involved in the transport of molecules across membranes, which is essential for maintaining lipid composition and homeostasis. ABCC4 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that can transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. SLC26A2 is a sulfate anion transporter, contributing to sulfate homeostasis and proper proteoglycan synthesis, which is important for cell membrane stability.

5. Proteins like GPD1L and GSR are involved in redox homeostasis, which is important for maintaining the integrity of cellular membranes. GPD1L plays a role in glycerol-3-phosphate metabolism, which is linked to phospholipid biosynthesis. GSR is glutathione reductase, which helps maintain the redox state of the cell, particularly in lipid membranes.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the synthesis, regulation, and transport of lipids and cholesterol, which are fundamental components of cellular membranes. The system also includes proteins that contribute to the maintenance of redox balance, which is crucial for the integrity of lipid membranes. The interplay between these proteins ensures the proper composition and functionality of cellular membranes, which is essential for various cellular processes, including signaling, energy production, and the maintenance of cellular structure."	0.85	0.0	4/17	1.3861013554149986e-06	0.000823331325743	ZMIZ1;PMEPA1;PLPP1;NKX3-1	Androgen Receptor Signaling Pathway 	GO:0030521	0	0.2490428	0.6878784	GO

Several proteins in this system, including COL3A1 (collagen type III alpha 1 chain), COL5A2 (collagen type V alpha 2 chain), LUM (lumican), and VCAN (versican), are key components or regulators of the extracellular matrix (ECM). They contribute to the structural integrity and biochemical composition of the ECM, which is crucial for tissue architecture and cell signaling.

2. Proteins such as TIMP1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1) and SPP1 (osteopontin) are involved in the regulation of ECM remodeling. TIMP1 inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are responsible for ECM degradation, while SPP1 interacts with integrins and CD44 to mediate cell-matrix interactions and can modulate MMP activity.

3. Angiogenesis-related proteins include VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A), which is a primary driver of blood vessel formation, and its receptor FGFR1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1). NRP1 (neuropilin 1) acts as a co-receptor for VEGFA, enhancing angiogenic signaling.

4. Proteins such as THBD (thrombomodulin) and PF4 (platelet factor 4) are involved in coagulation and inflammation, processes often associated with tissue remodeling and angiogenesis. THBD has anticoagulant properties, while PF4 is released by platelets and can inhibit angiogenesis, indicating a complex regulatory network.

5. The presence of integrins, such as ITGAV (integrin alpha-V), points to cell adhesion and signaling roles, which are essential for cells to interact with the ECM and for endothelial cells during new blood vessel formation.

6. Proteins like POSTN (periostin) and FSTL1 (follistatin-like 1) have roles in cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. POSTN interacts with integrins to support adhesion and migration, while FSTL1 can modulate angiogenesis and inflammation.

7. The Notch signaling pathway is represented by JAG1 (jagged 1) and JAG2 (jagged 2), which are ligands that interact with Notch receptors to influence cell fate decisions, including those related to vascular development.

8. Additional proteins such as APOH (apolipoprotein H), APP (amyloid beta precursor protein), and LRPAP1 (LDL receptor-related protein associated protein 1) have diverse roles, including lipid metabolism, cell adhesion, and protease inhibition, which can indirectly influence ECM remodeling and angiogenesis.

In summary, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the dynamic process of ECM remodeling and angiogenesis. They contribute to the structural organization of tissues, mediate cell-ECM interactions, regulate protease activity, and facilitate the formation of new blood vessels.

These processes are critical for cell shape, motility, and intercellular communication.

1. Actin proteins (ACTA1, ACTB, ACTC1, ACTG1, ACTG2) form the core of the cytoskeleton. They are involved in muscle contraction, cell motility, and maintenance of cell shape. Actin dynamics are regulated by actinin proteins (ACTN1, ACTN2, ACTN3, ACTN4), which crosslink actin filaments and link them to cellular junctions.

2. ADAM family proteins (ADAM15, ADAM23, ADAM9) and ADAMTS5 are involved in cell-matrix interactions, playing roles in cell adhesion, migration, and proteolytic processing of extracellular matrix components.

3. Cadherins (CDH1, CDH11, CDH15, CDH3, CDH4, CDH6, CDH8) are calcium-dependent adhesion molecules that mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion, crucial for tissue morphogenesis and integrity. Their interactions with catenins (CTNNA1, CTNND1) and actin filaments are vital for adherens junction formation and maintenance.

4. Claudins (CLDN11, CLDN14, CLDN15, CLDN18, CLDN19, CLDN4, CLDN5, CLDN6, CLDN7, CLDN8, CLDN9) are components of tight junctions, which regulate paracellular transport and maintain cell polarity.

5. Integrins (ITGA10, ITGA2, ITGA3, ITGA9, ITGB1, ITGB4) are transmembrane receptors that facilitate cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, transmitting mechanical signals and coordinating with growth factor receptors to influence cellular responses.

6. The Rho family of GTPases (RAC2, RRAS, RHOF) and their regulators (ARHGEF6, RASA1) orchestrate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, affecting cell shape, polarity, and migration.

7. The interplay between myosin proteins (MYH10, MYH9) and actin filaments is essential for cellular contractility and motility.

8. Focal adhesion components (PTK2, VCL, VASP) link the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton and are involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth, migration, and survival.

9. Nectins (NECTIN1, NECTIN2, NECTIN3, NECTIN4) and neurexins (NRXN2) contribute to cell-cell adhesion and the formation of synapses, mediating signaling pathways that influence cellular behavior.

10. Syndecans (SDC3) and other cell surface receptors (CD34, CD209, CD274, CD276, CD86, CD99) modulate cell adhesion and migration, often through interactions with the cytoskeleton and signaling pathways.

In summary, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion, which are fundamental for maintaining cellular architecture, facilitating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and enabling cellular responses to environmental cues. The high confidence score reflects the significant proportion of proteins in this system that contribute to these processes."	0.92	0.0	35/172	5.911342812378856e-36	1.0161598294479254e-32	ITGB1;AMIGO1;AMIGO2;NEXN;PKD1;CDH8;ICAM1;CDH6;TRO;CDH4;CDH3;CDH1;MPZL2;CADM3;VCAM1;CADM2;CLDN6;CLDN11;CLDN5;CLDN4;CLDN15;CLDN9;CD209;CLDN14;CLDN8;CLDN7;CDH11;CLDN19;PECAM1;CLDN18;CDH15;NECTIN4;NECTIN3;NECTIN2;NECTIN1	Cell-Cell Adhesion Via Plasma-Membrane Adhesion Molecules 	GO:0098742	0	0.45093575	0.41048712	Tied	"The proteins listed are involved in a complex network of interactions that primarily govern the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion dynamics. These processes are critical for cell shape, motility, and intercellular communication.

1. Actin proteins (ACTA1, ACTB, ACTC1, ACTG1, ACTG2) form the core of the cytoskeleton. They are involved in muscle contraction, cell motility, and maintenance of cell shape. Actin dynamics are regulated by actinin proteins (ACTN1, ACTN2, ACTN3, ACTN4), which crosslink actin filaments and link them to cellular junctions.[1][2][3]

2. ADAM family proteins (ADAM15, ADAM23, ADAM9) and ADAMTS5 are involved in cell-matrix interactions, playing roles in cell adhesion, migration, and proteolytic processing of extracellular matrix components.[4][5]

3. Cadherins (CDH1, CDH11, CDH15, CDH3, CDH4, CDH6, CDH8) are calcium-dependent adhesion molecules that mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion, crucial for tissue morphogenesis and integrity. Their interactions with catenins (CTNNA1, CTNND1) and actin filaments are vital for adherens junction formation and maintenance.[6][7][8][9]

4. Claudins (CLDN11, CLDN14, CLDN15, CLDN18, CLDN19, CLDN4, CLDN5, CLDN6, CLDN7, CLDN8, CLDN9) are components of tight junctions, which regulate paracellular transport and maintain cell polarity.[10][11][12][13]

5. Integrins (ITGA10, ITGA2, ITGA3, ITGA9, ITGB1, ITGB4) are transmembrane receptors that facilitate cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, transmitting mechanical signals and coordinating with growth factor receptors to influence cellular responses.[14][15][16]

6. The Rho family of GTPases (RAC2, RRAS, RHOF) and their regulators (ARHGEF6, RASA1) orchestrate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, affecting cell shape, polarity, and migration.[17]

7. The interplay between myosin proteins (MYH10, MYH9) and actin filaments is essential for cellular contractility and motility.[18]

8. Focal adhesion components (PTK2, VCL, VASP) link the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton and are involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth, migration, and survival.

Here is an analysis of the diversity of functions and lack of a unified process:

1. ADAM10, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase, is involved in the ectodomain shedding of various molecules, including Notch receptor processing. APP, or amyloid precursor protein, is a substrate of ADAM10 and is implicated in neuronal development and, when cleaved, in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

2. ADIPOR2 is an adiponectin receptor that plays a role in glucose metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. SLC2A4, also known as GLUT4, is an insulin-regulated glucose transporter found in adipose tissues and muscle.

3. BRCA1 is a well-known tumor suppressor gene involved in DNA damage repair, while GHRL, the gene encoding ghrelin, is a hormone involved in appetite regulation and energy homeostasis.

4. GATA3 is a transcription factor important for T-cell development and differentiation, whereas IL2RB and IL2RG are components of the interleukin-2 receptor complex, which is crucial for T-cell proliferation.

5. PCSK9 is involved in cholesterol homeostasis by mediating the degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors.

6. SLC22A12 and SLC34A3 are transporters involved in urate and phosphate homeostasis, respectively.

7. The presence of various other proteins such as kinases (LYN), heat shock proteins (HSPB1), and others involved in cell adhesion (EFNA5, EPHB4), signal transduction (AKAP7), and ion transport (ATP6V0A4, ATP8B1) further illustrates the diversity of this protein set.

Given the broad spectrum of unrelated functions, it is clear that these proteins do not collectively represent a singular biological process. The proteins are involved in various cellular processes such as metabolism, signal transduction, ion transport, and immune response, without a unifying theme that would suggest a predominant biological process. Therefore, the most accurate description for this system is a ""System of unrelated proteins"" with a confidence score of 0.00, indicating no confidence in the existence of a prominent biological process within this group."	0.0	0.0	3/9	8.267509091485156e-07	0.0003803511481345	ATP8B1;SHROOM2;MAL	Apical Protein Localization 	GO:0045176	0	0.29669034	0.6519042	GO

The proteins listed are heavily involved in apoptosis, the programmed cell death mechanism, and cell cycle regulation. Many of the proteins, such as BAX, BCL2L1, BCL2L11, and BID, are members of the BCL-2 family, which are key regulators of apoptosis. They control mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and can either promote or inhibit cell death.

2. CASP1, CASP2, CASP3, CASP6, CASP7, CASP8, and CASP9 are caspases, a family of protease enzymes playing essential roles in programmed cell death and inflammation. Initiator caspases like CASP8 and CASP9 are responsible for the early steps in the apoptosis signaling pathways, while executioner caspases like CASP3 and CASP7 are involved in the dismantling of cellular components.

3. Proteins such as CDK2, CCNA1, CCND1, and CCND2 are central to cell cycle regulation. CDK2 in complex with cyclins (CCNA1, CCND1, CCND2) drives the cell cycle progression through different phases by phosphorylating target substrates. CDKN1A and CDKN1B are cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that negatively regulate the cell cycle.

4. TNF, FAS, and FASLG are part of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. TNF and FASLG can bind to their respective receptors, initiating a cascade that leads to caspase activation. TNF can also activate NF-κB (RELA) signaling, which has a role in cell survival, proliferation, and inflammation.

5. DNA damage response proteins like BRCA1 and the P53 pathway, including PMAIP1 and CDKN1A, are also present. These proteins are involved in detecting DNA damage and can lead to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis if the damage is irreparable.

6. Anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL2L1, MCL1, and XIAP are also part of this system. They work by inhibiting the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins and caspases, contributing to cell survival.

7. Several stress response proteins like HSPB1, DNAJA1, and DNAJC3 are included, which help in protein folding and protection from stress-induced damage, potentially preventing apoptosis.

8. Inflammatory response proteins like IL1A, IL1B, IL6, and TNF are involved in cytokine signaling, which can influence cell survival, apoptosis, and the cell cycle.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the regulation of apoptosis and the cell cycle. They include a balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors, caspases, cell cycle regulators, DNA damage response proteins, and stress and inflammatory response elements. The interplay between these proteins ensures the proper execution of cell death and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, with implications for tissue development, immune responses, and the prevention of tumorigenesis."	0.95	0.0	59/705	3.5591551566526684e-44	7.506258225380472e-41	TOP2A;HSPB1;FASLG;CLU;TNF;CASP9;CCND2;CASP8;CASP6;CASP3;TNFSF10;CASP2;CD38;DNM1L;IER3;BNIP3L;DFFA;ANXA1;TNFRSF12A;HGF;RHOB;DNAJC3;SQSTM1;CD44;BIRC3;DIABLO;LEF1;PSEN2;XIAP;BCL10;PSEN1;RELA;BCL2L10;BCL2L11;ERBB3;ERBB2;PMAIP1;BMF;BID;MCL1;JUN;EGR3;GADD45B;BIK;GADD45A;MGMT;CFLAR;PTK2;SOD1;DNAJA1;BMP2;IL6;KRT18;PPT1;FAS;BAX;CTNNB1;BCL2L2;BCL2L1	Regulation Of Apoptotic Process 	GO:0042981	0	0.7550988	0.7365126	Tied	"1.

The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including ABCA1, ABCA2, ABCA3, ABCA4, ABCA5, ABCA6, ABCA8, ABCA9, ABCD1, ABCD2, ABCD3, ABCG4, and ABCG8, are integral membrane proteins that actively transport various molecules across extracellular and intracellular membranes. These proteins are known to be involved in the transport of lipids, such as cholesterol and phospholipids, across cell membranes, contributing to lipid homeostasis and potentially to the pathogenesis of lipid-related disorders.

2. Proteins such as ACSL1 and ACSL5 are part of the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase family, which play a crucial role in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation by converting free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters.

3. Enzymes like CYP27A1, CYP39A1, CYP46A1, CYP7A1, CYP7B1, and CYP8B1 are members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which are involved in the oxidation of various substrates, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Many of these enzymes are key players in cholesterol metabolism and bile acid synthesis.

4. Proteins such as HSD17B4, HSD17B6, and HSD3B7 are involved in steroid hormone metabolism, which is closely linked to lipid metabolism. These enzymes catalyze the conversion of steroid precursors into active hormones, which can influence energy balance and lipid storage.

5. Peroxisomal biogenesis factors, including PEX1, PEX11A, PEX11G, PEX12, PEX13, PEX16, PEX19, PEX26, PEX6, and PEX7, are essential for the proper function and maintenance of peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are involved in the catabolism of very long-chain fatty acids, branched-chain fatty acids, and bile acid intermediates, highlighting their role in lipid metabolism.

6. Proteins such as APOA1 and NR1H4 (FXR, a nuclear receptor) are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and transport. APOA1 is a major component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and plays a critical role in cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport. NR1H4 is a key regulator of bile acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the metabolism, regulation, and transport of lipids. They participate in various aspects of lipid handling, including fatty acid activation, cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, steroid hormone synthesis, and the formation and function of lipid transport particles.

The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including ABCA1, ABCA2, ABCA3, ABCA4, ABCA5, ABCA6, ABCA8, ABCA9, ABCD1, ABCD2, ABCD3, ABCG4, and ABCG8, are integral membrane proteins that actively transport various molecules across extracellular and intracellular membranes. These proteins are known to be involved in the transport of lipids, such as cholesterol and phospholipids, across cell membranes, contributing to lipid homeostasis and potentially to the pathogenesis of lipid-related disorders.[1][2][3][4]

2. Proteins such as ACSL1 and ACSL5 are part of the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase family, which play a crucial role in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation by converting free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters.

3. Enzymes like CYP27A1, CYP39A1, CYP46A1, CYP7A1, CYP7B1, and CYP8B1 are members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which are involved in the oxidation of various substrates, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Many of these enzymes are key players in cholesterol metabolism and bile acid synthesis.[5]

4. Proteins such as HSD17B4, HSD17B6, and HSD3B7 are involved in steroid hormone metabolism, which is closely linked to lipid metabolism. These enzymes catalyze the conversion of steroid precursors into active hormones, which can influence energy balance and lipid storage.

5. Peroxisomal biogenesis factors, including PEX1, PEX11A, PEX11G, PEX12, PEX13, PEX16, PEX19, PEX26, PEX6, and PEX7, are essential for the proper function and maintenance of peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are involved in the catabolism of very long-chain fatty acids, branched-chain fatty acids, and bile acid intermediates, highlighting their role in lipid metabolism.[6][7][8]

6. Proteins such as APOA1 and NR1H4 (FXR, a nuclear receptor) are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and transport. APOA1 is a major component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and plays a critical role in cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport. NR1H4 is a key regulator of bile acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the metabolism, regulation, and transport of lipids. They participate in various aspects of lipid handling, including fatty acid activation, cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, steroid hormone synthesis, and the formation and function of lipid transport particles. The interplay between these proteins ensures the maintenance of lipid homeostasis, which is vital for cellular function and energy balance. The high proportion of genes in the system that contribute to lipid-related processes justifies the high confidence score.

The proteins in this system are predominantly involved in nucleic acid metabolism, including DNA replication, repair, transcription, and RNA processing. Many of these proteins are essential for the accurate duplication and maintenance of the genome, as well as for the proper expression of genes.

2. Proteins such as POLA1, POLB, POLD1, POLE4, and the RFC complex are directly involved in DNA replication. They work together to ensure that DNA is accurately copied during the S phase of the cell cycle. POLA1, POLB, POLD1, and POLE4 are DNA polymerases, while the RFC complex acts as a clamp loader for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is also present in this system.

3. DNA repair is represented by proteins like ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC3, ERCC4, ERCC5, and ERCC8, which are part of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. This pathway corrects DNA lesions caused by UV light and chemical mutagens. RAD51 and RAD52 are involved in homologous recombination, a mechanism for repairing double-strand breaks.

4. Transcription factors and general transcription machinery components such as GTF2A2, GTF2B, GTF2F1, GTF2H1, and the POLR2 family are crucial for the transcription of DNA into RNA. They form the core of the RNA polymerase II complex, which transcribes mRNA.

5. RNA processing and modification are represented by proteins like CSTF3, which is involved in 3' end processing of mRNA, and the SMN complex, which is essential for the biogenesis of ribonucleoproteins, including spliceosomal snRNPs.

6. Nucleotide metabolism is also a significant theme, with enzymes like IMPDH2, GMPR2, and NT5C3A playing roles in the synthesis and degradation of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA and RNA.

7. Additional proteins such as TP53 are key regulators of the cell cycle and can induce apoptosis in response to DNA damage, thus maintaining genomic integrity.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are functionally integrated into the complex processes of nucleic acid metabolism and DNA repair mechanisms. They work in concert to ensure the fidelity of genetic information through its replication, repair, and expression.

These processes are critical for proper cell division and the prevention of genomic instability, which can lead to diseases such as cancer.

1. Cell Cycle Regulation: Many of the proteins, such as CDK1, CDK4, CCNB2, CCNE1, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors like CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN2A, are directly involved in the control of the cell cycle. CDK1, in complex with cyclins such as CCNB2, drives the cell through mitosis, while CDK4, in association with CCNE1, is important for the G1/S transition. The inhibitors modulate the activity of CDKs, ensuring proper timing of cell cycle events.

2. Chromosome Segregation and Mitosis: Proteins like AURKA, AURKB, BUB1B, and MAD2L1 are essential for chromosome segregation and the proper progression of mitosis. Aurora kinases A and B are involved in centrosome maturation, spindle assembly, and cytokinesis. BUB1B and MAD2L1 are components of the spindle assembly checkpoint that prevents anaphase until all chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle.

3. DNA Replication and Repair: Proteins such as MCM2-7, PCNA, RPA1-3, and DNA polymerases (POLA2, POLD1-3, POLE) are involved in DNA replication. The MCM complex acts as the replicative helicase, PCNA is the sliding clamp for DNA polymerases, and RPA proteins stabilize single-stranded DNA. RAD50, MRE11, NBN, BRCA1, and BRCA2 are involved in DNA repair, particularly homologous recombination, which is crucial for repairing double-strand breaks.

4. Chromatin Organization and Modification: Proteins like HMGA1, HMGB2, HMGB3, and histone modifiers such as EZH2 (part of the PRC2 complex) and SUV39H1 are involved in chromatin organization and epigenetic regulation. These modifications can influence gene expression and are also important during replication and repair to restore chromatin structure.

5. Checkpoint Control and Apoptosis: CHEK1, CHEK2, TP53, and BIRC5 (Survivin) are key components of the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoints. TP53 is a well-known tumor suppressor that can induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. CHEK1 and CHEK2 are kinases that mediate cell cycle checkpoints and facilitate DNA repair.

6. Cytoskeletal Dynamics: Proteins such as TUBB, TUBG1, and various kinesins (e.g., KIF2C, KIF4A) are involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, which is crucial for cell division, particularly during mitosis when the mitotic spindle must form and function correctly to ensure proper chromosome segregation.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system work in concert to ensure the accurate replication of the genome and its equal distribution to daughter cells during cell division. They are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, DNA replication and repair, chromatin modification, checkpoint control, and cytoskeletal dynamics. The interplay between these proteins maintains genomic stability and prevents the propagation of damaged DNA, which is essential for the prevention of oncogenesis and the preservation of cellular integrity."	0.98	0.0	51/288	2.630437768350129e-49	2.85665541642824e-46	TOP2A;DCLRE1B;MRE11;MCM7;HMGB2;HMGB3;BRCA1;CHEK1;NBN;KPNA2;POLE;RFC3;LIG1;RFC2;HUS1;SMC1A;RAD51C;MSH2;TIMELESS;MCM3;MCM4;MCM5;MCM6;DCTPP1;ASF1A;MCM2;PRIM2;RNASEH2A;PRKDC;PDS5B;UNG;RAD51AP1;POLD3;ORC6;RAD21;POLD1;ORC2;POLD2;BARD1;DUT;XRCC6;RPA1;DONSON;RPA2;NAP1L1;POLA2;RAD50;RPA3;UBE2T;CDK1;RAN	DNA Metabolic Process 	GO:0006259	0	0.40027928	0.2732444	LLM	"The proteins listed are predominantly involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and the maintenance of genomic stability.

The ECM is a complex network of proteins that provides structural support to cells and tissues and plays a crucial role in cell signaling, differentiation, and migration.

1. A large number of collagens (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL4A1, COL4A2, etc.) are present, which are the main structural proteins in the ECM, providing tensile strength and integrity to tissues.

2. Proteoglycans such as decorin (DCN), biglycan (BGN), and versican (VCAN) are also part of the ECM, contributing to the matrix's resilience and hydration, and modulating growth factor activities.

3. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP14) and their inhibitors (TIMP1, TIMP3) are involved in the remodeling of the ECM, which is essential for processes like wound healing, angiogenesis, and development.

4. Integrins (ITGA2, ITGA5, ITGAV, ITGB1, ITGB3, ITGB5) and other cell adhesion molecules (e.g., CD44, VCAM1) mediate cell-ECM interactions, which are critical for cell migration, survival, and communication.

5. Growth factors and cytokines (e.g., TGFBI, TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFC, IL6) and their receptors (e.g., PDGFRB, TGFBR3) are key regulators of ECM synthesis and degradation, as well as modulators of cellular responses such as proliferation and differentiation.

6. Fibronectin (FN1), laminins (LAMA1, LAMA2, LAMA3, LAMC1, LAMC2), and elastin (ELN) are ECM proteins that contribute to the architecture and elasticity of the ECM, influencing tissue morphology and mechanics.

7. Additional proteins such as thrombospondins (THBS1, THBS2), tenascin (TNC), and osteopontin (SPP1) are involved in cell-matrix interactions and modulate cell behavior and tissue repair.

8. Several signaling molecules and transcription factors (e.g., SNAI2, JUN, NOTCH2) are implicated in the regulation of ECM components and in the response of cells to the ECM environment.

In summary, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the composition, structure, and dynamic remodeling of the ECM, as well as in the modulation of signals between the ECM and cells. This system plays a fundamental role in maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating communication between cells and their surrounding matrix, which is essential for proper tissue function and response to injury.

The proteins ACAA1, ACAA2, ACADL, ACADM, ACADS, ACADVL, and ACAT2 are all involved in the breakdown of fatty acids through beta-oxidation. This process occurs in the mitochondria and peroxisomes, where fatty acids are converted into acetyl-CoA, which can then enter the citric acid cycle for energy production.

2. ACO2, ACOT2, ACOT8, and ACOX1 are also key components of fatty acid metabolism. ACOX1, in particular, is the first enzyme in the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway, which is responsible for the shortening of very long-chain fatty acids.

3. ACSL1, ACSL4, and ACSL5 are long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases that play a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism by converting free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters, which can then be metabolized or used in the synthesis of lipids.

4. CPT1A and CPT2 are carnitine palmitoyltransferases that are essential for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.

5. CRAT and CROT are carnitine acetyltransferases involved in the regulation of the acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio within the mitochondria, which is important for maintaining the balance between fatty acid oxidation and carbohydrate metabolism.

6. ECH1, ECHS1, ECI1, ECI2, and HADH are enzymes involved in various steps of the mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation spiral, further supporting the prominent role of this protein system in fatty acid catabolism.

7. HADHB is a subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, which is an enzyme complex that catalyzes the last three steps of mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids.

8. The presence of PPARA, a nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and metabolism, suggests a regulatory role for this protein system in the overall process.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly involved in the catabolism of fatty acids, particularly through the process of beta-oxidation, and the regulation of this metabolic pathway. The system appears to be highly integrated, with multiple enzymes working in concert to ensure efficient breakdown of fatty acids for energy production, indicating a strong focus on fatty acid oxidation and metabolism as the primary biological process."	0.92	0.0	22/49	5.074902368871481e-34	4.7602584220014505e-31	GCDH;ACADVL;ACOT8;ACAA2;ECHS1;ECI1;ECI2;ETFDH;HSD17B4;HSD17B10;ACAT2;HADHB;ACADL;AUH;CPT2;ACOX1;EHHADH;ACADM;ACAA1;ACADS;CRAT;DECR1	Fatty Acid Beta-Oxidation 	GO:0006635	0	0.86744744	0.74228406	LLM	"1.

These processes are critical for proper cell division and the prevention of genomic instability, which can lead to diseases such as cancer.

1. Several proteins, including ABL1, ATRX, BARD1, BRCA2, BUB1, BUB3, CDC20, CDC25A, CDC25B, CDC27, CDC45, CDC6, CDC7, CDK1, CDK4, CDKN1B, CDKN2C, CDKN3, CHEK1, and CHK2, are key regulators of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair mechanisms. They ensure that cells do not proceed to the next phase of the cell cycle until damaged DNA is repaired or that the cell undergoes apoptosis if the damage is irreparable.

2. Proteins such as CCNA2, CCNB2, CCND1, CCNF, and CCNT1 are cyclins that bind to and regulate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are crucial for the transition between different phases of the cell cycle.

3. The kinetochore proteins CENPA, CENPE, CENPF, and KNL1, along with spindle assembly checkpoint proteins MAD2L1 and BUB1, ensure proper chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis, preventing aneuploidy.

4. Proteins involved in DNA replication and synthesis, such as MCM2-7 complex members, POLA2, POLE, and PRIM2, are essential for the accurate duplication of the genome prior to cell division.

5. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) components, such as CDC20 and CDC27, are involved in the regulation of proteolysis of cell cycle regulators, ensuring proper progression through mitosis.

6. Proteins like AURKA and AURKB are aurora kinases that play a critical role in the regulation of mitosis, particularly in the formation of the mitotic spindle, centrosome separation, and cytokinesis.

7. The structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complex proteins, such as SMC1A, SMC2, and SMC4, are involved in sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome condensation, which are vital for maintaining chromosomal stability during cell division.

8. DNA damage response proteins, such as RAD21, RAD23B, and RAD54L, along with tumor suppressors like BRCA2 and BARD1, are crucial for the repair of double-strand breaks and the maintenance of genomic integrity.

In summary, the proteins in this system work in a highly coordinated manner to control the cell cycle's progression, ensuring that DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and mitosis occur accurately and efficiently.

SLC25A37 and SLC25A38 are mitochondrial transporters that import iron for heme synthesis. TFRC is the transferrin receptor, responsible for iron uptake from transferrin in the blood.

3. Proteins like ACP5 (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase), involved in bone resorption, and CA1 and CA2 (carbonic anhydrases), which participate in CO2 transport and pH balance, are indirectly related to erythropoiesis as they contribute to the bone marrow environment and RBC function.

The proteins in this system are involved in a wide array of cellular processes, but a common theme among many of them is their role in cellular stress response and metabolic regulation. This includes the response to hypoxia, oxidative stress, and nutrient availability, as well as the regulation of glucose metabolism and angiogenesis.

2. Several proteins such as HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha) and VHL (von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor) are key components of the cellular response to hypoxia. HIF-1α is stabilized under low oxygen conditions and activates the transcription of numerous genes involved in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glycolysis. VHL is part of the protein complex that targets HIF-1α for degradation under normoxic conditions.

3. Proteins like GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), ENO1/2/3 (alpha, gamma, and beta enolase), and PKM (pyruvate kinase) are central to glycolysis, indicating a significant role for this system in energy metabolism. These enzymes are involved in the breakdown of glucose for energy production, especially under anaerobic conditions or when mitochondrial respiration is compromised.

4. The presence of proteins such as SLC2A1 (GLUT1), SLC2A3 (GLUT3), and SLC2A5 (GLUT5) suggests a role in glucose transport across the cell membrane, which is crucial for maintaining cellular energy levels and responding to changes in glucose availability.

5. Stress response elements are represented by proteins like ATF3 (activating transcription factor 3), DDIT3 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3), and HSPA5 (heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5), which are involved in the unfolded protein response and the regulation of apoptosis in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress.

6. Angiogenic factors such as VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A) and angiopoietins (e.g., ANGPTL4) are involved in the regulation of blood vessel formation, which is critical for supplying tissues with oxygen and nutrients, especially during periods of rapid growth or in response to hypoxic conditions.

7. Proteins like BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) and BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3-like) are involved in the regulation of apoptosis, which can be triggered by various stressors, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and nutrient deprivation.

8. Transcription factors such as JUN, FOS, and FOXO3 are implicated in the regulation of genes that respond to oxidative stress and contribute to the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are functionally integrated to manage cellular stress responses and metabolic regulation. They work together to ensure cellular adaptation and survival under conditions of stress, such as hypoxia, oxidative damage, and nutrient fluctuations, while also playing roles in energy metabolism and angiogenesis.

4. The presence of proteins such as SLC2A1 (GLUT1), SLC2A3 (GLUT3), and SLC2A5 (GLUT5) suggests a role in glucose transport across the cell membrane, which is crucial for maintaining cellular energy levels and responding to changes in glucose availability.[4][5]

5. Stress response elements are represented by proteins like ATF3 (activating transcription factor 3), DDIT3 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3), and HSPA5 (heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5), which are involved in the unfolded protein response and the regulation of apoptosis in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress.[6]

6. Angiogenic factors such as VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A) and angiopoietins (e.g., ANGPTL4) are involved in the regulation of blood vessel formation, which is critical for supplying tissues with oxygen and nutrients, especially during periods of rapid growth or in response to hypoxic conditions.[7]

7. Proteins like BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) and BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3-like) are involved in the regulation of apoptosis, which can be triggered by various stressors, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and nutrient deprivation.[8]

8. Transcription factors such as JUN, FOS, and FOXO3 are implicated in the regulation of genes that respond to oxidative stress and contribute to the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.[9][10]

To summarize, the proteins in this system are functionally integrated to manage cellular stress responses and metabolic regulation. They work together to ensure cellular adaptation and survival under conditions of stress, such as hypoxia, oxidative damage, and nutrient fluctuations, while also playing roles in energy metabolism and angiogenesis. The interplay between these proteins allows the cell to maintain homeostasis and respond dynamically to environmental changes.

The proteins listed are predominantly involved in immune response and inflammatory signaling pathways. These proteins include cytokines (e.g., IL1B, IL6, TNF), cytokine receptors (e.g., IL1R1, IL2RG, IL6ST, TNFRSF1A), and signaling intermediates (e.g., STAT1, STAT3, MYD88, GRB2).

2. Cytokines such as IL1B, IL6, and TNF are key mediators of inflammation, capable of activating various cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. They are produced by immune cells and act on a wide range of tissues to regulate immune responses and inflammation.

3. Cytokine receptors, including those for interleukins (e.g., IL1R1, IL2RG, IL6ST) and tumor necrosis factors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF1B), are critical for the specificity and regulation of cytokine signaling. These receptors mediate the effects of cytokines by activating downstream signaling cascades.

4. Signal transduction proteins such as STAT1, STAT3, and MYD88 are involved in the transduction of signals from cytokine receptors to the nucleus, where they influence gene expression. STAT proteins are activated by Janus kinases (JAKs) and translocate to the nucleus to modulate the transcription of genes involved in immune responses.

5. The presence of toll-like receptors (TLR2) and adaptors like MYD88 indicates a role in pathogen recognition and the initiation of innate immune responses. These proteins are essential for the detection of microbial components and the activation of inflammatory signaling pathways.

6. Negative regulators of cytokine signaling, such as SOCS1 and SOCS3, are also present, indicating a tightly controlled system where both activation and inhibition are crucial to prevent excessive inflammation.

The proteins ADAR, EIF2AK2 (also known as PKR), IFIH1 (MDA5), and OAS1 are part of the antiviral response. ADAR is an RNA-editing enzyme that can modify viral RNA, potentially inhibiting viral replication. EIF2AK2 is a kinase that phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2α), leading to inhibition of protein synthesis in viral-infected cells. IFIH1 is a cytoplasmic sensor of viral RNA that activates the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) to induce type I interferon production. OAS1 synthesizes 2',5'-oligoadenylates that activate RNase L, leading to RNA degradation in infected cells.

2. IRF1, IRF2, IRF7, and IRF9 are transcription factors that regulate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). They play a crucial role in the transcriptional activation of genes in response to interferon signaling.

3. ISG15, ISG20, MX1, RSAD2 (also known as viperin), and the TRIM family proteins (TRIM14, TRIM21, TRIM25, TRIM26, TRIM5) are ISGs with antiviral activities. ISG15 is involved in protein ISGylation, a ubiquitin-like modification that can disrupt viral replication. MX1 has GTPase activity and can block the replication of certain viruses. The TRIM proteins have various roles, including the regulation of innate immune signaling pathways and direct antiviral effects.

4. The proteins PSMB8 and PSMB9 are immunoproteasome subunits that are induced by interferon and are involved in the generation of antigenic peptides for presentation by MHC class I molecules, such as HLA-C, to cytotoxic T cells.

5. TAP1 is involved in the transport of antigenic peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecules.

6. The chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL11 are involved in the recruitment of immune cells to sites of infection or inflammation.

7. Proteins such as BST2 (tetherin) and IFITM proteins (IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3) have direct antiviral effects by inhibiting the release of budding viral particles or by blocking virus entry into host cells.

8. CASP1 and CASP8 are caspases involved in the inflammatory response and apoptosis, which can be part of the cellular response to viral infection.

9. CD74 is involved in antigen presentation and also serves as a receptor for the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), linking innate immunity to adaptive immune responses.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the innate immune response to viral infection and the subsequent activation of interferon signaling pathways. They function to detect viral components, inhibit viral replication, and activate immune cells, leading to the production of interferons and the expression of ISGs with antiviral activities. The system also includes components that are involved in antigen processing and presentation, further bridging innate and adaptive immunity.

A significant number of proteins in this system, such as ACTN4 (alpha-actinin-4), FLNA (Filamin A), and VCL (Vinculin), are involved in cytoskeletal organization. These proteins interact with actin filaments and contribute to the maintenance of cell shape, adhesion, and motility. They are essential for cellular integrity and the transmission of mechanical stress.

2. Proteins like AURKA (Aurora kinase A), BUB1 (BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase), CDC27 (Cell division cycle 27), and PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1) are key regulators of mitosis. They are involved in chromosome alignment, segregation, and the overall progression of the cell cycle. These proteins ensure accurate mitotic spindle formation and cytokinesis.

3. Kinesin family members such as KIF11 (Kinesin family member 11), KIF20B, and KIF23 are molecular motors that play crucial roles in microtubule dynamics, which are vital for mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation during cell division.

4. Centrosomal and spindle pole proteins like CENPE (Centromere protein E), CENPF (Centromere protein F), and NUMA1 (Nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1) are critical for the proper organization and stabilization of the spindle poles, ensuring correct bipolar spindle formation and function.

5. Proteins involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, such as CDC42 (Cell division control protein 42 homolog), RACGAP1 (Rac GTPase-activating protein 1), and WASL (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome-like), coordinate cell shape changes with mitotic events. They are crucial for the formation of the contractile ring during cytokinesis.

6. Several proteins in this system, including BIRC5 (Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5), also known as survivin, and BCL2L11 (BCL2-like 11), are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell survival, which are processes closely linked to cell division.

7. Proteins such as APC (Adenomatous polyposis coli) and BRCA2 (Breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein) have roles in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair mechanisms, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability during cell division.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton and the regulation of mitotic cell division.

1. Several proteins such as DDIT3 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3), also known as CHOP, and XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) are key components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, which is part of the unfolded protein response (UPR). These proteins are involved in restoring normal function of the cell by halting protein translation and activating signaling pathways that lead to increased production of molecular chaperones.

2. Proteins like HSP90B1, HSPA4, HSPA5, HSPA9, HSPD1, and HSPE1 are molecular chaperones that assist in protein folding and protect cells from stress by preventing aggregation of misfolded proteins.

3. Lipid metabolism is represented by proteins such as ACACA (acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha) and ACLY (ATP citrate lyase), which are crucial enzymes in fatty acid biosynthesis. SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is involved in the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids. FADS1 and FADS2 (fatty acid desaturases) are involved in the desaturation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

4. Cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation are highlighted by proteins such as HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, and INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1), which plays a role in the feedback regulation of cholesterol synthesis.

5. Proteins involved in redox homeostasis, such as G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and GSR (glutathione reductase), are critical for maintaining the cellular redox balance and protecting against oxidative stress.

6. The presence of multiple subunits of the proteasome (e.g., PSMA3, PSMA4, PSMB5, PSMC2, PSMC4, PSMC6, PSMD12, PSMD13, PSMD14, PSME3) and proteins involved in ubiquitination (e.g., UBE2D3) suggests a role in protein degradation and turnover, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and stress response.

7. Glycolytic enzymes such as ALDOA (aldolase A), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and HK2 (hexokinase 2) indicate a connection to energy metabolism, which is often upregulated during stress conditions.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in responding to cellular stress through the UPR and in maintaining lipid and redox homeostasis. The system also includes elements of protein quality control and energy metabolism, which are integral to the cell's ability to cope with and adapt to various stressors. The name ""Cellular Stress Response and Lipid Metabolism"" reflects the dual focus on managing protein misfolding and regulating lipid synthesis and metabolism, which are processes that often intersect, particularly under stress conditions.

The proteins can be grouped based on their functions as follows:

1. Cell Cycle Regulation and DNA Replication: Proteins such as CCNA2, CDC20, CDK2, CDK4, MCM2, MCM4, MCM5, MCM6, MCM7, PCNA, and RFC4 are integral to the control of the cell cycle and DNA replication. Cyclins, CDKs, and the MCM complex are essential for the progression through different phases of the cell cycle and initiation of DNA replication, respectively.

2. Protein Synthesis and Ribosome Biogenesis: A large subset of proteins, including EIF1AX, EIF2S1, EIF2S2, EIF3B, EIF3D, EIF3J, EIF4A1, EIF4E, EIF4G2, EIF4H, RPL14, RPL18, RPL22, RPL34, RPL6, RPLP0, RPS10, RPS2, RPS3, RPS5, RPS6, and MRPL23, are involved in the translation process and ribosome biogenesis. These include eukaryotic initiation factors, ribosomal proteins, and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, which are crucial for protein synthesis.

3. RNA Processing and Transport: Proteins such as CSTF2, NCBP1, NCBP2, PABPC1, PABPC4, PRPF31, SNRPA, SNRPA1, SNRPB2, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, and SNRPG are involved in RNA splicing, polyadenylation, and nuclear export. These processes are essential for the maturation and transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

4. Stress Response and Chaperones: HSP90AB1, HSPD1, HSPE1, CCT2, CCT3, CCT4, CCT5, CCT7, and TCP1 are molecular chaperones that assist in protein folding and protect cells from stress. The chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex is particularly important for the folding of actin, tubulin, and other cytosolic proteins.

5. Metabolism and Energy Production: Proteins such as GOT2, LDHA, PGK1, and SLC25A3 are involved in metabolic pathways and energy production. These proteins are critical for the glycolytic pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and mitochondrial function.

6. Protein Degradation and Turnover: The proteasome subunits (PSMA1, PSMA2, PSMA4, PSMA6, PSMA7, PSMB2, PSMB3, PSMC4, PSMC6, PSMD1, PSMD14, PSMD3, PSMD7, PSMD8) and ubiquitination-related proteins (CUL1, UBA2, UBE2E1, UBE2L3) are responsible for protein degradation and turnover, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and the regulation of various cellular processes.

7. DNA Repair and Genomic Stability: Proteins such as APEX1, PCNA, RAD23B, and XRCC6 are involved in DNA repair mechanisms that maintain genomic stability.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are involved in the fundamental processes of cell proliferation and the maintenance of the protein synthesis machinery. These processes are tightly interconnected, as the synthesis of proteins is essential for cell growth and division, and the cell cycle machinery must be precisely regulated to ensure proper cell proliferation.

1. The TCA cycle is represented by proteins such as IDH1/2 (isocitrate dehydrogenases), SDHA/B/C/D (succinate dehydrogenase complex), FH (fumarate hydratase), and MDH1/2 (malate dehydrogenases). These enzymes catalyze sequential reactions in the TCA cycle, a central metabolic pathway that provides electrons for the electron transport chain (ETC) and precursors for biosynthetic pathways.

2. The ETC is represented by numerous NADH dehydrogenases (NDUFA1-9, NDUFB1-8, NDUFC1/2, NDUFS1-8, NDUFV1/2), succinate dehydrogenase complex subunits (SDHA/B/C/D), ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex subunits (UQCR10/11/B/C1/C2/FS1/H/Q), and cytochrome c oxidase subunits (COX4I1, COX5A/B, COX6A1/B1/C, COX7A2/A2L/B/C, COX8A). These proteins are integral to the ETC, which generates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, driving ATP synthesis.

3. ATP synthase complex subunits (ATP5F1A/B/C/D/E, ATP5MC1/2/3, ATP5ME/F, ATP5MG/PB/PD/PF/PO) are responsible for the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate, utilizing the proton gradient established by the ETC.

4. Proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation include ACADM/ACADSB/ACADVL (acyl-CoA dehydrogenases), ECH1 (enoyl-CoA hydratase), and HADHA/B (hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase). These enzymes catalyze the breakdown of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, which can enter the TCA cycle.

5. Mitochondrial biogenesis and maintenance are represented by proteins such as TFAM (mitochondrial transcription factor A), TFB1M/TFB2M (mitochondrial transcription factor B), and POLRMT (mitochondrial RNA polymerase), which are involved in the transcription of mitochondrial DNA. Proteins like OPA1 and MFN2 are involved in mitochondrial dynamics, including fusion and fission processes.

6. Proteins involved in the import and assembly of mitochondrial proteins include TOMM22/70 (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane), TIMM8B/9/10/13/17A/50 (translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane), and chaperones such as HSPA9 and GRPEL1.

7. Additional proteins like AIFM1 (apoptosis-inducing factor), BAX, and CASP7 are involved in apoptotic processes, indicating a link between energy metabolism and programmed cell death.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are intricately involved in the processes that govern mitochondrial energy production, including the TCA cycle, ETC, ATP synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis and maintenance. The system reflects a highly integrated network essential for cellular energy homeostasis, with additional roles in apoptosis.

Several proteins in this system, such as ATF3, DDIT3 (also known as CHOP), DDIT4, FOS, JUN, and TP53, are transcription factors that are activated in response to various forms of cellular stress, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These factors can induce the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, metabolism, and apoptosis.

2. Proteins like BAX, BAK1, APAF1, CASP1, and FAS are key components of the apoptotic machinery. BAX and BAK1 are pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family that promote mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leading to cytochrome c release and APAF1-mediated activation of caspases, such as CASP1. FAS is a death receptor that can initiate extrinsic apoptotic signaling.

3. DNA damage response is represented by proteins such as DDB2, ERCC5, PCNA, and RAD51C, which are involved in nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and homologous recombination, respectively. These proteins help maintain genomic integrity by repairing DNA lesions.

4. The presence of proteins like CDKN1A (p21), CDKN2A (p16), and RB1 indicates involvement in cell cycle regulation. These proteins can induce cell cycle arrest in response to stress signals, preventing the propagation of damaged DNA.

5. Oxidative stress response is indicated by the presence of proteins such as HMOX1, GPX2, and FDXR, which are involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintenance of redox homeostasis.

6. Proteins like GADD45A and H2AX (H2AC25 and H2AJ) are involved in the cellular response to DNA damage and can facilitate DNA repair or signal for apoptosis if the damage is irreparable.

7. The presence of NOTCH1 and TGFB1 suggests a role in cellular differentiation and proliferation, which can be influenced by stress signaling pathways.

8. Autophagy is represented by proteins such as DRAM1 and EI24, which can be induced under stress conditions to promote cellular survival by degrading damaged organelles and proteins.

The proteins ABCC8, G6PC2, GCG, GCK, INS, IAPP, and SLC2A2 are directly involved in the regulation of glucose levels and insulin secretion. ABCC8 is a subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in pancreatic beta cells, which regulates insulin secretion in response to glucose levels. G6PC2 is involved in glucose metabolism and regulation of blood glucose levels. GCG (glucagon) and INS (insulin) are hormones with opposing actions in glucose homeostasis. GCK acts as a glucose sensor in pancreatic beta cells. IAPP (amylin) is co-secreted with insulin and modulates the rate of glucose entering the bloodstream. SLC2A2 (GLUT2) is a glucose transporter in beta cells, critical for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

2. Transcription factors such as FOXA2, FOXO1, HNF1A, INSM1, ISL1, MAFB, NEUROD1, NEUROG3, NKX2-2, NKX6-1, PAX4, PAX6, and PDX1 play key roles in the development and differentiation of pancreatic islet cells. These factors are involved in the complex regulatory networks that establish the pancreatic endocrine lineage and maintain the functional identity of beta cells.

3. Proteins like CHGA, SCGN, and STXBP1 are associated with the secretory granules of endocrine cells, including the packaging and secretion of hormones such as insulin and glucagon.

The proteins ABCC8, G6PC2, GCG, GCK, INS, IAPP, and SLC2A2 are directly involved in the regulation of glucose levels and insulin secretion. ABCC8 is a subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in pancreatic beta cells, which regulates insulin secretion in response to glucose levels. G6PC2 is involved in glucose metabolism and regulation of blood glucose levels. GCG (glucagon) and INS (insulin) are hormones with opposing actions in glucose homeostasis. GCK acts as a glucose sensor in pancreatic beta cells. IAPP (amylin) is co-secreted with insulin and modulates the rate of glucose entering the bloodstream. SLC2A2 (GLUT2) is a glucose transporter in beta cells, critical for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.[1][2][3][4][5]

This process is critical for the movement of molecules between different compartments within cells, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endosomes, and the plasma membrane.

1. Proteins such as ARF1, ARFGAP3, ARFGEF1, ARFGEF2, and ARFIP1 are part of the ADP-ribosylation factor family and their associated proteins. They are involved in vesicle formation and trafficking by regulating coat assembly on the membranes of the Golgi and endosomes.

2. The adaptor protein (AP) complexes, including AP1G1, AP2B1, AP2M1, AP2S1, AP3B1, and AP3S1, are involved in the selection of cargo for inclusion in transport vesicles. They play a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the sorting of cargo in the trans-Golgi network and endosomes.

3. Clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) and clathrin light chain (CLTA), along with other assembly proteins, are responsible for the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, which are pivotal in the endocytosis and trafficking of membrane proteins and lipids.

4. COPB1, COPB2, COPE, and other COPI and COPII coat proteins are involved in vesicle formation and trafficking between the ER and the Golgi apparatus.

5. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs), such as BET1, STX12, STX16, STX7, VAMP3, VAMP4, and VAMP7, mediate the fusion of vesicles with target membranes, which is essential for the delivery of vesicular cargo.

6. Small GTPases like RAB14, RAB22A, RAB2A, RAB5A, and RAB9A, along with their effectors, are key regulators of vesicle trafficking, each associated with different stages of vesicle transport.

7. Motor proteins such as KIF1B are involved in the transport of vesicles along microtubules, which is essential for the long-range distribution of vesicles within the cell.

8. Proteins involved in the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, such as LAMP2, M6PR (mannose-6-phosphate receptor), and CTSC (cathepsin C), are critical for the degradation and recycling of cellular components.

9. Proteins like IGF2R (insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor) and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and signaling endosomes, linking vesicular transport with signal transduction pathways.

10. ATPases such as ATP1A1 and components of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase like ATP6V1B1 and ATP6V1H are involved in the acidification of vesicles, which is crucial for the function of lysosomes and endosomes.

In summary, the proteins in this system work in concert to ensure the proper sorting, packaging, transport, and delivery of cellular cargo. This includes the formation of vesicles, selection of cargo, vesicle budding and fission, transport along cytoskeletal elements, tethering, docking, and fusion with target membranes, as well as the recycling of vesicles and their components.

The Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β) pathway is a key regulator of various cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and specification of developmental fate. Proteins such as TGFB1, TGFBR1, and SMAD family members (SMAD1, SMAD3, SMAD6, SMAD7) are central to the TGF-β signaling cascade. Upon ligand binding, TGF-β receptors phosphorylate receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs), which then form complexes with SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression.

2. The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway, a branch of the TGF-β superfamily, is represented by proteins such as BMP2, BMPR1A, BMPR2, and SMAD1. This pathway is crucial for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis, influencing cell fate, proliferation, and apoptosis.

3. The process of EMT, where epithelial cells lose their characteristics and gain mesenchymal properties, is influenced by TGF-β signaling. Proteins such as CDH1 (E-cadherin) are downregulated during EMT, while others like SNAIL (not listed but often regulated by SMADs) are upregulated. This process is critical in development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis.

4. Negative regulation of TGF-β signaling is mediated by inhibitory SMADs (SMAD6 and SMAD7) and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of signaling components by SMURF1 and SMURF2. This ensures a tightly controlled response to TGF-β signaling.

5. The Wnt signaling pathway, which is involved in cell fate determination, is represented by proteins such as APC, CTNNB1 (β-catenin), and TCF/LEF family members (not listed but often associated with β-catenin). The interplay between TGF-β and Wnt signaling pathways is crucial for the regulation of EMT and cellular differentiation.

6. Crosstalk with other signaling pathways is evident through proteins like MAP3K7 (TAK1), which is involved in the NF-κB pathway, and JUNB, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex. These interactions highlight the integration of TGF-β signaling with other cellular responses to environmental cues.

7. The system also includes proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling, such as HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1), ARID4B (a member of the SWI/SNF family), and NCOR2 (nuclear receptor corepressor 2), which can modulate the transcriptional outcomes of TGF-β signaling.

8. Several proteins in the system are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, such as CDKN1C (p57Kip2), which inhibits cyclin-CDK complexes, and CDK9, a component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, linking TGF-β signaling to cell cycle control.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway and its downstream effects, including the regulation of EMT. This system of proteins demonstrates a complex network of interactions that govern cellular responses to TGF-β, mediate crosstalk with other signaling pathways, and regulate gene expression to control cell fate, proliferation, and differentiation."	0.94	0.0	21/130	9.427259531410516e-33	1.0954475575499018e-29	ACVR1;TGFB1;BMPR2;SMAD3;SMURF2;SMURF1;FURIN;LTBP2;SMAD6;TGFBR1;HIPK2;SMAD7;SKI;FKBP1A;BMP2;FNTA;ID1;MAP3K7;LEFTY2;BMPR1A;ENG	Transmembrane Receptor Protein Serine/Threonine Kinase Signaling Pathway 	GO:0007178	0	0.7433284	0.616875	LLM	"1. The Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β) pathway is a key regulator of various cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and specification of developmental fate. Proteins such as TGFB1, TGFBR1, and SMAD family members (SMAD1, SMAD3, SMAD6, SMAD7) are central to the TGF-β signaling cascade. Upon ligand binding, TGF-β receptors phosphorylate receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs), which then form complexes with SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression.[1]

2. The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway, a branch of the TGF-β superfamily, is represented by proteins such as BMP2, BMPR1A, BMPR2, and SMAD1. This pathway is crucial for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis, influencing cell fate, proliferation, and apoptosis.[2][3]

3. The process of EMT, where epithelial cells lose their characteristics and gain mesenchymal properties, is influenced by TGF-β signaling. Proteins such as CDH1 (E-cadherin) are downregulated during EMT, while others like SNAIL (not listed but often regulated by SMADs) are upregulated. This process is critical in development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis.

The proteins ALDH18A1, ASNS, ATF3, ATF4, ATF6, CEBPB, CEBPG, CHAC1, DDIT4, DNAJB9, DNAJC3, EDEM1, EIF2AK3, EIF2S1, HSPA5, HYOU1, and XBP1 are key components of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) and Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). These pathways are activated in response to various cellular stresses, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, to restore protein homeostasis. ATF4, ATF6, and XBP1 are transcription factors that upregulate genes involved in protein folding, trafficking, and degradation to alleviate ER stress.

2. Proteins such as CALR, PDIA5, PDIA6, ERO1A, and HSP90B1 are involved in protein folding within the ER, ensuring that proteins achieve their proper conformation. Their activity is crucial for maintaining protein quality control and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins.

3. The exosome complex components EXOSC1, EXOSC2, EXOSC4, EXOSC5, EXOSC9, and EXOSC10, along with the decapping enzymes DCP1A and DCP2, are involved in RNA degradation. This process regulates the levels of specific mRNAs, thereby controlling the translation of proteins and contributing to cellular homeostasis.

4. EIF4A1, EIF4A2, EIF4A3, EIF4E, EIF4EBP1, EIF4G1, and RPS14 are part of the translation initiation machinery, which is tightly regulated during stress conditions. Phosphorylation of EIF2S1 by EIF2AK3 inhibits global protein synthesis, reducing the load on the ER during stress.

5. The protein transport machinery, including ARFGAP1, BAG3, GOSR2, KDELR3, SEC11A, SEC31A, SLC1A4, SLC30A5, SLC7A5, SRPRA, SRPRB, SSR1, and YIF1A, is essential for trafficking proteins to their correct cellular locations. This system is crucial for the secretion of proteins and the maintenance of cellular compartmentalization.

6. Proteins such as BANF1, CCL2, CKS1B, DNAJA4, EEF2, FKBP14, GEMIN4, H2AX, HSPA9, IARS1, IFIT1, IGFBP1, IMP3, KHSRP, KIF5B, LSM1, LSM4, MTHFD2, MTREX, NABP1, NFYA, NFYB, NHP2, NOLC1, NOP14, NOP56, NPM1, PAIP1, PARN, POP4, PREB, PSAT1, RRP9, SDAD1, SERP1, SHC1, SKIC3, STC2, TARS1, TATDN2, TSPYL2, TUBB2A, VEGFA, WFS1, WIPI1, XPOT, YWHAZ, and ZBTB17 are involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and metabolic pathways. Their roles are diverse, but they contribute to the overall cellular response to stress and the maintenance of homeostasis.

In summary, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the ISR and UPR, which are critical for maintaining protein homeostasis under stress conditions.

The proteins ALDH18A1, ASNS, ATF3, ATF4, ATF6, CEBPB, CEBPG, CHAC1, DDIT4, DNAJB9, DNAJC3, EDEM1, EIF2AK3, EIF2S1, HSPA5, HYOU1, and XBP1 are key components of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) and Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). These pathways are activated in response to various cellular stresses, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, to restore protein homeostasis. ATF4, ATF6, and XBP1 are transcription factors that upregulate genes involved in protein folding, trafficking, and degradation to alleviate ER stress.[1][2][3][4]

2. Proteins such as CALR, PDIA5, PDIA6, ERO1A, and HSP90B1 are involved in protein folding within the ER, ensuring that proteins achieve their proper conformation. Their activity is crucial for maintaining protein quality control and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins.[5]

3. The exosome complex components EXOSC1, EXOSC2, EXOSC4, EXOSC5, EXOSC9, and EXOSC10, along with the decapping enzymes DCP1A and DCP2, are involved in RNA degradation. This process regulates the levels of specific mRNAs, thereby controlling the translation of proteins and contributing to cellular homeostasis.[6][7][8]

4. EIF4A1, EIF4A2, EIF4A3, EIF4E, EIF4EBP1, EIF4G1, and RPS14 are part of the translation initiation machinery, which is tightly regulated during stress conditions. Phosphorylation of EIF2S1 by EIF2AK3 inhibits global protein synthesis, reducing the load on the ER during stress.[9][10][11]

5. The protein transport machinery, including ARFGAP1, BAG3, GOSR2, KDELR3, SEC11A, SEC31A, SLC1A4, SLC30A5, SLC7A5, SRPRA, SRPRB, SSR1, and YIF1A, is essential for trafficking proteins to their correct cellular locations. This system is crucial for the secretion of proteins and the maintenance of cellular compartmentalization.

6. Proteins such as BANF1, CCL2, CKS1B, DNAJA4, EEF2, FKBP14, GEMIN4, H2AX, HSPA9, IARS1, IFIT1, IGFBP1, IMP3, KHSRP, KIF5B, LSM1, LSM4, MTHFD2, MTREX, NABP1, NFYA, NFYB, NHP2, NOLC1, NOP14, NOP56, NPM1, PAIP1, PARN, POP4, PREB, PSAT1, RRP9, SDAD1, SERP1, SHC1, SKIC3, STC2, TARS1, TATDN2, TSPYL2, TUBB2A, VEGFA, WFS1, WIPI1, XPOT, YWHAZ, and ZBTB17 are involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and metabolic pathways. Their roles are diverse, but they contribute to the overall cellular response to stress and the maintenance of homeostasis.

In summary, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the ISR and UPR, which are critical for maintaining protein homeostasis under stress conditions. They work in concert to ensure proper protein folding, degradation of misfolded proteins, and regulation of protein synthesis. The system also includes proteins that contribute to RNA processing and protein transport, further supporting cellular homeostasis. The high confidence score reflects the significant proportion of genes in the system that participate in these interconnected processes.

2. Signal transduction and cellular communication: Proteins like ARRB2 (beta-arrestin 2, involved in GPCR desensitization), PRKACA (protein kinase A catalytic subunit), and RASGRP1 (Ras guanyl-releasing protein) play roles in various signaling pathways.

The Wnt signaling pathway is a complex network of proteins that play crucial roles in embryonic development, cell proliferation, differentiation, and stem cell maintenance. Key components of this pathway include WNT1, WNT5B, WNT6 (ligands), FZD1, FZD8 (receptors), LRP5/6 (co-receptors), AXIN1, AXIN2, DVL2, and CTNNB1 (β-catenin). Upon Wnt ligand binding, the destruction complex (AXIN1, AXIN2, GSK3, CK1) is inhibited, leading to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin (CTNNB1), which interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors (TCF7, LEF1) to activate Wnt target gene expression.

2. The Notch signaling pathway is another critical regulator of cell fate decisions, tissue homeostasis, and stem cell maintenance. It involves the interaction of Notch receptors (NOTCH1, NOTCH4) with their ligands (DLL1, JAG1, JAG2), leading to proteolytic cleavage by γ-secretase (PSEN2) and release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The NICD translocates to the nucleus and associates with RBPJ to modulate gene transcription. HEY1 and HEY2 are examples of Notch-responsive genes.

3. The interplay between Wnt and Notch signaling pathways is evident in this system, as both pathways can influence each other and are often involved in similar cellular contexts, such as stem cell niches and cancer. For instance, AXIN2 is a target of the Wnt pathway and can also negatively regulate Notch signaling, while NOTCH signaling can influence the expression of Wnt target genes.

4. Cell cycle regulation is represented by proteins such as CCND2 (cyclin D2), which is involved in the G1/S transition, and SKP2, which is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, targeting proteins for degradation and thus controlling cell cycle progression. TP53 (p53) is a tumor suppressor that regulates the cell cycle and can induce apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

5. Crosstalk between these pathways and the cell cycle is mediated by several proteins. For example, MYC, a well-known proto-oncogene, is a target of Wnt signaling and can also influence cell cycle progression. HDACs (HDAC2, HDAC5, HDAC11) are involved in chromatin remodeling and can affect the transcription of Wnt/Notch target genes, while NCOR2 can interact with HDACs to repress transcription.

6. Negative regulation of Wnt signaling is performed by DKK1 and DKK4, which are antagonists that bind to LRP5/6 co-receptors, and by NKD1, which acts intracellularly. GNAI1 is a G protein involved in the non-canonical Wnt pathway, which also affects cell movement and polarity.

7. Additional regulation is provided by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation pathways, involving proteins such as CUL1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which can target β-catenin for degradation, thus modulating the intensity and duration of Wnt signaling.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, which are integrated with cell cycle regulation. These pathways are critical for controlling cell fate, proliferation, and differentiation, and their dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including cancer. The system reflects a tightly regulated network where multiple proteins contribute to the balance of signaling and cellular outcomes."	0.94	0.0	10/40	4.236927578358607e-19	2.951406004414456e-16	JAG2;ADAM17;NOTCH1;JAG1;HEY1;MAML1;NOTCH4;HEY2;RBPJ;DLL1	Notch Signaling Pathway 	GO:0007219	0	0.6460779	0.6031543	Tied	"1.

The proteins ABCC2, ABCC3, and other members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, such as ABCD2, are involved in the transport of various molecules across extra- and intracellular membranes. These proteins play a significant role in the hepatic excretion of metabolites and xenobiotics, contributing to detoxification and drug resistance mechanisms.

2. Enzymes like ADH1C, ADH5, ADH7 (alcohol dehydrogenases), ALDH2, ALDH3A1, ALDH9A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenases), AKR1C2, AKR1C3 (aldo-keto reductases), and CYP family members including CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2J2, and CYP4F2 are central to the metabolism of a wide range of substances, including drugs, toxins, and endogenous compounds. They are primarily expressed in the liver and are key players in phase I and phase II metabolic reactions.

3. Proteins such as GSTA3, GSTM4, GSTO1, and GSTT2 (glutathione S-transferases) are involved in the conjugation of reduced glutathione to xenobiotic metabolites, which is a crucial step in the detoxification process. This phase II reaction makes the compounds more water-soluble and thus easier to excrete.

4. Enzymes like G6PC1 (glucose-6-phosphatase) are involved in glucose metabolism and homeostasis, particularly in the liver, where they contribute to the maintenance of blood glucose levels through gluconeogenesis.

5. HNF4A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in hepatic glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and the response to drugs and toxins.

6. Proteins such as SLC22A1 (solute carrier family 22 member 1) are involved in the transport of organic ions and drugs across the cell membrane, playing a role in the uptake and excretion of xenobiotics.

7. Enzymes like XDH (xanthine dehydrogenase) are involved in the catabolism of purines, which is important for the regulation of uric acid levels in the body.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the metabolic processes of the liver, with a strong emphasis on the metabolism and detoxification of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds.

These proteins interact in various complexes and pathways to modulate the accessibility of chromatin to the transcriptional machinery and to regulate the transcription of genes in response to developmental cues and environmental signals.

1. The ARID family proteins (ARID1A, ARID1B, and ARID2) are components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression by altering chromatin structure to allow access to transcription factors.

2. ATRX, CHD2, CHD4, and the SMARCA proteins (SMARCA1, SMARCA4) are also chromatin remodelers that play roles in altering nucleosome positioning and chromatin structure, influencing gene expression patterns during development and cell differentiation.

3. The histone modifiers, including HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3), EZH2 (a component of the PRC2 complex), KDM5A, KDM6A, and the KMT2 family (KMT2A, KMT2B, KMT2C, KMT2D), are involved in the post-translational modification of histones, which can either repress or activate transcription depending on the specific modification.

4. DNA methylation is another layer of epigenetic regulation, with DNMTs (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B) responsible for adding methyl groups to DNA, which generally leads to transcriptional repression.

5. Transcription factors such as GATA3, MYC, E2F1, and SOX2 are directly involved in the activation or repression of target gene transcription, playing key roles in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation.

6. Proteins involved in DNA repair and genomic stability, such as BRD4, PARP1, TP53, and XRCC1, also interact with components of the transcriptional machinery, linking DNA damage responses with transcriptional regulation.

7. The cohesion complex proteins (RAD21, SMC1A, SMC3, STAG1, STAG2) and CTCF are involved in the organization of higher-order chromatin structure and in the regulation of gene expression through the formation of chromatin loops and boundaries.

8. Splicing factors (SF1, SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2) and other RNA-binding proteins (FUS, RBM10) influence post-transcriptional regulation, which can affect the stability and translation of mRNAs.

9. The presence of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation (CDK12, RB1) and signaling pathways (PTPN11, TNF) suggests an integration of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation with cell cycle control and response to extracellular signals.

In summary, the proteins in this system are highly interconnected and function in a coordinated manner to regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. This regulation is essential for proper cell function, development, and response to environmental changes. The system's primary role is to ensure that the correct genes are expressed at the right time and place, which is fundamental to the maintenance of cellular identity and function.

CUL3, FBXW7, SKP1, and VHL are components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), specifically involved in the targeted degradation of proteins. CUL3 serves as a scaffold protein in the assembly of Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which are crucial for the ubiquitination of proteins destined for proteasomal degradation. FBXW7 is a substrate recognition component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, targeting numerous proteins involved in cell cycle progression and growth for ubiquitination. SKP1 is part of the SCF complex, acting as an adaptor that connects the F-box protein to CUL1. VHL is part of the VBC (VHL-Elongin B-Elongin C) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, targeting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for degradation under normoxic conditions.

2. ELOC, also known as Elongin C, is a component of the VBC complex and is involved in the regulation of transcription by forming a complex with Elongin B and a transcription factor with a ubiquitin-like domain. This complex can also interact with Cullin proteins to form E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, linking the control of transcription to protein degradation.

3. HSP90AA1 is a molecular chaperone that assists in the proper folding of proteins, including kinases and hormone receptors. It is also involved in the stabilization of proteins against heat stress and has a role in the signaling pathways that lead to the activation of heat shock factor (HSF) and the subsequent transcription of heat shock proteins.

4. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates the ubiquitination of p53/TP53, leading to its degradation. MDM2 is a key regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway and is involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis.

5. STK11, also known as LKB1, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and is a major upstream kinase for the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which is important for cellular responses to low energy levels.

6. TNF is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that stimulate the acute phase reaction. It is mainly secreted by macrophages and can induce cell death of certain tumor cell lines. It is also involved in the regulation of immune cells.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway, which is essential for the regulation of various cellular processes including cell cycle, growth, and response to stress. The system also includes proteins that are involved in cellular stress responses, such as HSP90AA1, which helps in protein folding and protection against stress, and TNF, which is involved in inflammation and immune responses. The interplay between these proteins ensures the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by regulating protein turnover and responding to cellular stress signals."	0.92	0.0	6/364	2.7978201122382354e-09	1.3709318549967354e-06	FBXW7;CUL3;MDM2;VHL;ELOC;SKP1	Protein Modification By Small Protein Conjugation 	GO:0032446	0	0.51481295	0.35950246	LLM	"1.

ELOC, also known as Elongin C, is a component of the VBC complex and is involved in the regulation of transcription by forming a complex with Elongin B and a transcription factor with a ubiquitin-like domain. This complex can also interact with Cullin proteins to form E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, linking the control of transcription to protein degradation.

3. HSP90AA1 is a molecular chaperone that assists in the proper folding of proteins, including kinases and hormone receptors. It is also involved in the stabilization of proteins against heat stress and has a role in the signaling pathways that lead to the activation of heat shock factor (HSF) and the subsequent transcription of heat shock proteins.[4]

4. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates the ubiquitination of p53/TP53, leading to its degradation. MDM2 is a key regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway and is involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis.[5]

5. STK11, also known as LKB1, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and is a major upstream kinase for the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which is important for cellular responses to low energy levels.[6]

6. TNF is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that stimulate the acute phase reaction. It is mainly secreted by macrophages and can induce cell death of certain tumor cell lines. It is also involved in the regulation of immune cells.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway, which is essential for the regulation of various cellular processes including cell cycle, growth, and response to stress. The system also includes proteins that are involved in cellular stress responses, such as HSP90AA1, which helps in protein folding and protection against stress, and TNF, which is involved in inflammation and immune responses. The interplay between these proteins ensures the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by regulating protein turnover and responding to cellular stress signals.

E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 are members of the E2F family of transcription factors, which play a crucial role in controlling the cell cycle by regulating the expression of genes required for DNA replication and cell cycle progression. These proteins are typically active in the early stages of the cell cycle and are involved in the transition from the G1 to the S phase.

2. E2F4 and E2F5 are also part of the E2F family, but they are generally associated with transcriptional repression and are active in the later stages of the cell cycle. They contribute to the exit from the cell cycle and maintenance of the quiescent state.

3. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates the p53 tumor suppressor. It controls the stability of p53 by targeting it for proteasomal degradation, thus playing a role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.

4. RB1, RBL1 (p107), and RBL2 (p130) are members of the retinoblastoma protein family. They are key regulators of the cell cycle through their ability to bind E2F transcription factors and inhibit their activity, preventing the transcription of genes required for S phase entry.

5. TFDP1, also known as DP1, forms heterodimers with E2F transcription factors, enhancing their DNA binding and transcriptional activity. It is essential for the function of E2F proteins in cell cycle control.

CREBBP (CREB-binding protein) and EP300 (E1A binding protein p300) are closely related transcriptional co-activators that possess histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. They play a critical role in regulating chromatin structure and transcription through acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins. This modification leads to an open chromatin conformation and subsequent transcriptional activation. Both proteins interact with numerous transcription factors and are involved in the regulation of genes important for cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

2. HDAC1 (Histone Deacetylase 1) is part of the histone deacetylase family that counteracts the action of histone acetyltransferases like CREBBP and EP300 by removing acetyl groups from histones, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression.

They form a complex that is responsible for the 5' incision during excision of damaged DNA. ERCC1-XPF is essential for the repair of DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation and certain chemical mutagens.

2. MLH1 (MutL Homolog 1), MLH3 (MutL Homolog 3), PMS1 (Postmeiotic Segregation Increased 1), and PMS2 (Postmeiotic Segregation Increased 2) are key components of the mismatch repair (MMR) system. MLH1 forms heterodimers with PMS2, MLH3, or PMS1, which are involved in the repair of base-base mismatches and insertion-deletion loops that arise during DNA replication and recombination. The MLH1-PMS2 heterodimer (MutLα) is the predominant form for MMR in humans.

3. MSH2 (MutS Homolog 2), MSH3 (MutS Homolog 3), and MSH6 (MutS Homolog 6) are also integral to the MMR pathway. MSH2 forms heterodimers with MSH6 (MutSα) or MSH3 (MutSβ). MutSα recognizes and binds to base-base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops, while MutSβ is specialized for larger insertion-deletion loops. These complexes initiate the MMR process by recognizing and binding to the errors.

4. SLX4 (SLX4 Structure-Specific Endonuclease Subunit) acts as a scaffold for multiple structure-specific endonucleases and is involved in the repair of interstrand cross-links (ICLs) and in the maintenance of telomeres.

3. MSH2 (MutS Homolog 2), MSH3 (MutS Homolog 3), and MSH6 (MutS Homolog 6) are also integral to the MMR pathway. MSH2 forms heterodimers with MSH6 (MutSα) or MSH3 (MutSβ). MutSα recognizes and binds to base-base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops, while MutSβ is specialized for larger insertion-deletion loops. These complexes initiate the MMR process by recognizing and binding to the errors.[3]

4. SLX4 (SLX4 Structure-Specific Endonuclease Subunit) acts as a scaffold for multiple structure-specific endonucleases and is involved in the repair of interstrand cross-links (ICLs) and in the maintenance of telomeres. It interacts with ERCC4 and other nucleases like SLX1, and is involved in the resolution of Holliday junctions during homologous recombination.[4]

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the recognition and repair of various types of DNA damage, including base mismatches, insertions, deletions, and bulky lesions. They are crucial for maintaining genomic stability by preventing mutations that could lead to cancer and other genetic diseases. The system of proteins works in a coordinated manner to ensure the integrity of the genome through various repair pathways, including nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and the repair of interstrand cross-links. The high degree of interconnectivity and the essential nature of these processes in preventing genomic instability justify the high confidence score.

AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3, collectively known as AKT or Protein Kinase B, are central players in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. They are serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that regulate a variety of cellular processes including metabolism, proliferation, cell survival, growth, and angiogenesis. Each isoform has a slightly different role, with AKT1 being more involved in cellular survival mechanisms, AKT2 in glucose metabolism, and AKT3 primarily in brain development.

2. FOXO3 is a member of the forkhead class of DNA-binding proteins. It is a transcription factor that is negatively regulated by AKT phosphorylation. When phosphorylated by AKT, FOXO3 is excluded from the nucleus and thus inhibited from transcribing genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and oxidative stress resistance.

3. HSP90AA1 is a molecular chaperone that plays a crucial role in the folding, stability, and function of many client proteins, including AKT. It is involved in protecting AKT from proteasomal degradation, thus indirectly influencing the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.

4. PDPK1 (3-Phosphoinositide Dependent Protein Kinase-1) is responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of AKT. PDPK1 itself is activated by the products of PI3K, linking it directly to the PI3K-AKT signaling cascade.

5. PIK3CB and PIK3CD encode the catalytic subunits of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), which are activated by various cellular stimuli and produce lipid second messengers that initiate the AKT signaling pathway.

6. PRKCZ (Protein Kinase C Zeta) and PRKDC (Protein Kinase, DNA-Activated, Catalytic Polypeptide) are kinases that can interact with the PI3K-AKT pathway. PRKCZ is involved in insulin signaling and can be activated by PI3K products, while PRKDC is involved in DNA repair and can influence cell survival, potentially interacting with the pathway in stress responses.

7. PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog) is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a lipid phosphatase, which dephosphorylates the 3' phosphate of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, a product of PI3K. This action directly opposes PI3K and serves as a negative regulator of the AKT signaling pathway.

In summary, the proteins in this system are intricately involved in the regulation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. This pathway is critical for cell survival and function, and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including cancer.

AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3, collectively known as AKT or Protein Kinase B, are central players in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. They are serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that regulate a variety of cellular processes including metabolism, proliferation, cell survival, growth, and angiogenesis. Each isoform has a slightly different role, with AKT1 being more involved in cellular survival mechanisms, AKT2 in glucose metabolism, and AKT3 primarily in brain development.[1]

2. FOXO3 is a member of the forkhead class of DNA-binding proteins. It is a transcription factor that is negatively regulated by AKT phosphorylation. When phosphorylated by AKT, FOXO3 is excluded from the nucleus and thus inhibited from transcribing genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and oxidative stress resistance.[2]

3. HSP90AA1 is a molecular chaperone that plays a crucial role in the folding, stability, and function of many client proteins, including AKT. It is involved in protecting AKT from proteasomal degradation, thus indirectly influencing the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.[3]

4. PDPK1 (3-Phosphoinositide Dependent Protein Kinase-1) is responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of AKT. PDPK1 itself is activated by the products of PI3K, linking it directly to the PI3K-AKT signaling cascade.[4]

5. PIK3CB and PIK3CD encode the catalytic subunits of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), which are activated by various cellular stimuli and produce lipid second messengers that initiate the AKT signaling pathway.[5]

6. PRKCZ (Protein Kinase C Zeta) and PRKDC (Protein Kinase, DNA-Activated, Catalytic Polypeptide) are kinases that can interact with the PI3K-AKT pathway. PRKCZ is involved in insulin signaling and can be activated by PI3K products, while PRKDC is involved in DNA repair and can influence cell survival, potentially interacting with the pathway in stress responses.

7. PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog) is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a lipid phosphatase, which dephosphorylates the 3' phosphate of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, a product of PI3K. This action directly opposes PI3K and serves as a negative regulator of the AKT signaling pathway.[6]

In summary, the proteins in this system are intricately involved in the regulation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. This pathway is critical for cell survival and function, and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including cancer. The proteins listed function in a tightly regulated manner to ensure proper signaling, with AKT isoforms as the central mediators, PDPK1, PI3Ks, and HSP90AA1 as positive regulators, and PTEN as a negative regulator. FOXO3 acts as a downstream effector whose activity is modulated by AKT. The interplay between these proteins ensures the fidelity of signal transduction and the appropriate cellular response to external and internal stimuli.[7][8]

PPP2CA and PPP2CB encode the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase. PP2A is involved in the negative control of cell growth and division. It participates in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, transcription, translation, and signal transduction pathways.

2. PPP2R1A and PPP2R1B encode the scaffolding A subunits of PP2A. These subunits are critical for the assembly of the PP2A holoenzyme, which consists of a structural A subunit, a regulatory B subunit, and a catalytic C subunit. The A subunits serve as a platform for the B and C subunits to bind, thereby influencing the substrate specificity and localization of the PP2A complex.

3. PPP2R2A encodes a regulatory B subunit of PP2A. The B subunits are responsible for targeting the PP2A complex to specific substrates or cellular locations. They play a key role in modulating the activity of the PP2A holoenzyme by altering its substrate specificity and are involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways.

The proteins in this system work together to form the PP2A holoenzyme complex, which is a major cellular phosphatase that dephosphorylates serine and threonine residues in a variety of substrates.

It forms heterodimers with PMS2, PMS1, and MLH3, which are involved in the repair of DNA mismatches and small insertion/deletion loops. MLH1 also participates in DNA damage signaling and can induce apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

2. MSH2 forms the MutSα heterodimer with MSH6 and the MutSβ heterodimer with MSH3. These complexes are responsible for the initial recognition of mismatched nucleotides during the DNA repair process. MutSα recognizes base-base mismatches and insertion/deletion loops, while MutSβ is specialized for larger insertion/deletion loops.

3. MSH3, as part of the MutSβ complex with MSH2, is involved in the recognition and repair of insertion and deletion loops that escape the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases. It enhances the MMR efficiency for larger loop mismatches that are not well recognized by MutSα.

4. MSH6, when complexed with MSH2 to form MutSα, is involved in the recognition of base-base mismatches and small insertion/deletion loops. It plays a critical role in the early steps of MMR by identifying and binding to these errors.

5. PMS2 forms a heterodimer with MLH1, known as MutLα, which is essential for the later stages of MMR. This complex is involved in the excision and resynthesis of the error-containing strand of DNA.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are integral components of the mismatch repair system, a highly conserved and critical pathway for maintaining genomic stability by correcting DNA replication errors. The proteins work in a coordinated manner to recognize and repair mismatches and insertion/deletion loops. The MutS complexes (MSH2-MSH6 and MSH2-MSH3) initiate the repair process by recognizing and binding to the errors, while the MutL complexes (MLH1-PMS2) are involved in the subsequent steps that lead to the actual repair of the DNA strand.

APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) is a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway. It forms part of a complex with AXIN1 and GSK3B, which regulates the stability and localization of CTNNB1 (beta-catenin). APC mutations are implicated in colorectal cancer, where dysregulated Wnt signaling leads to increased cellular proliferation.

2. AXIN1 is a scaffold protein that is a critical component of the beta-catenin destruction complex, which includes APC and GSK3B. It promotes the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of beta-catenin, thereby inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway. AXIN1 mutations or alterations can disrupt this process, leading to aberrant activation of Wnt target genes.

3. CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) is a dual-function protein involved in regulation and coordination of cell–cell adhesion and gene transcription. In the absence of Wnt signaling, CTNNB1 is phosphorylated by the destruction complex, leading to its degradation. When Wnt signaling is active, CTNNB1 accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of Wnt target genes.

4. GSK3B (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Beta) is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates beta-catenin, priming it for ubiquitination and degradation. It is a key negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. GSK3B is also involved in various other cellular processes, including glycogen metabolism, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis.

5. HLA-A is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule that plays a crucial role in the immune system by presenting endogenous peptides to CD8+ T cells. It is not directly involved in the Wnt signaling pathway but may interact with components of the pathway or be influenced by Wnt signaling-mediated immunomodulatory effects.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this set (APC, AXIN1, CTNNB1, GSK3B) are directly involved in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination. The presence of HLA-A suggests a potential link between Wnt signaling and immune system modulation, as Wnt signaling can influence the expression of MHC molecules and thus affect immune responses. The interplay between these proteins highlights the integration of developmental signaling pathways with immune regulation, which is critical in maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing diseases such as cancer."	0.88	0.0	4/220	7.062162487949307e-08	2.266954158631728e-05	GSK3B;APC;AXIN1;CTNNB1	Proteasomal Protein Catabolic Process 	GO:0010498	0	0.43062988	0.3689537	LLM	"1.

These processes are critical for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression.

1. Chromatin remodeling is facilitated by proteins such as ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, BAP1, BRD4, CHD2, CHD4, CREBBP, EP300, EZH2, HDAC1-5, KDM5A, KMT2A-D, SMARCA1, SMARCA4, SMARCB1, and SMARCE1. These proteins function as part of larger complexes that modify histones and DNA, thereby altering the chromatin structure to regulate access to DNA for transcription, replication, and repair.

2. DNA damage response and repair mechanisms involve ATM, ATR, ATRX, BARD1, BRCA1 (not listed but closely associated with PALB2 and RAD51), CHEK2, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, FANCD2, MDM2, MDM4, PALB2, PARP1, RAD21, RAD50, TP53, WRN, and XRCC1. These proteins detect and repair DNA damage, coordinate cell cycle checkpoints, and, if necessary, initiate apoptosis to prevent the propagation of damaged DNA.

3. Transcriptional regulation is a key function of many proteins in this system, including AR (androgen receptor), ESR1 (estrogen receptor), MYC, MYB, MYCN, GATA1, GATA3, NCOA3, NCOR1, NCOR2, RB1, and TP53. These proteins interact with DNA and other transcription factors to control gene expression patterns essential for cell growth, differentiation, and response to environmental signals.

4. RNA processing and modification are represented by proteins such as DDX3X, DIS3, DKC1, PRPF40B, SF1, SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2. These proteins are involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including splicing, editing, and stability, which are crucial for the proper expression and function of genes.

5. Cell cycle regulation and signal transduction pathways include proteins like CDK8, CDKN1A, CUL3, MAX, RAF1, RANBP2, RBL1, and TNF. These proteins integrate signals from various pathways to control cell proliferation and apoptosis.

These processes are critical for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression.

1. Chromatin remodeling is facilitated by proteins such as ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, BAP1, BRD4, CHD2, CHD4, CREBBP, EP300, EZH2, HDAC1-5, KDM5A, KMT2A-D, SMARCA1, SMARCA4, SMARCB1, and SMARCE1. These proteins function as part of larger complexes that modify histones and DNA, thereby altering the chromatin structure to regulate access to DNA for transcription, replication, and repair.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]

2. DNA damage response and repair mechanisms involve ATM, ATR, ATRX, BARD1, BRCA1 (not listed but closely associated with PALB2 and RAD51), CHEK2, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, FANCD2, MDM2, MDM4, PALB2, PARP1, RAD21, RAD50, TP53, WRN, and XRCC1. These proteins detect and repair DNA damage, coordinate cell cycle checkpoints, and, if necessary, initiate apoptosis to prevent the propagation of damaged DNA.[14][15][16][17][18][19][20]

3. Transcriptional regulation is a key function of many proteins in this system, including AR (androgen receptor), ESR1 (estrogen receptor), MYC, MYB, MYCN, GATA1, GATA3, NCOA3, NCOR1, NCOR2, RB1, and TP53. These proteins interact with DNA and other transcription factors to control gene expression patterns essential for cell growth, differentiation, and response to environmental signals.[21][22][23][24][25][26]

4. RNA processing and modification are represented by proteins such as DDX3X, DIS3, DKC1, PRPF40B, SF1, SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2. These proteins are involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including splicing, editing, and stability, which are crucial for the proper expression and function of genes.[27][28][29][30]

5. Cell cycle regulation and signal transduction pathways include proteins like CDK8, CDKN1A, CUL3, MAX, RAF1, RANBP2, RBL1, and TNF. These proteins integrate signals from various pathways to control cell proliferation and apoptosis.[31][32][33][34]

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in chromatin remodeling and the DNA damage response. These processes are tightly interconnected, as the proper regulation of chromatin structure is essential for both the access of DNA repair machinery to damaged sites and the regulation of genes involved in the DNA damage response. The high confidence score reflects the significant proportion of genes in the system that participate in these processes.

BCL2, BCL2L1 (also known as Bcl-xL), BCL2L11 (also known as Bim), BCL2L2 (also known as Bcl-w), and MCL1 are members of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins. These proteins are central regulators of the apoptotic process, with BCL2, BCL2L1, and MCL1 functioning primarily as anti-apoptotic proteins, while BCL2L11 serves as a pro-apoptotic factor. The balance between these proteins determines cell survival or death, with their interactions influencing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a critical event in apoptosis.

2. CASP8 (caspase-8) is an initiator caspase that plays a key role in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. It is activated upon the binding of extracellular death ligands to death receptors like FAS (also known as CD95). Upon activation, CASP8 can cleave and activate downstream effector caspases, leading to apoptosis.

3. FAS is a cell surface death receptor that, upon binding with its ligand (FasL), forms a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) that includes and activates CASP8. This receptor-ligand interaction is a crucial component of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

4. IFNGR1 is the receptor for interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a cytokine that can promote apoptosis in certain contexts. IFN-γ signaling can lead to the upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes and enhance the susceptibility of cells to apoptotic stimuli.

5. MS4A1 (also known as CD20) is a protein expressed on the surface of B cells. While not directly involved in apoptosis, its expression is regulated during B cell development and activation, which can be influenced by apoptotic signaling.

6. PARP1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) is a nuclear enzyme involved in DNA repair and programmed cell death. It is a substrate for caspases and, when cleaved, serves as a marker for cells undergoing apoptosis.

7. PTPN13 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 13) is a large protein phosphatase that can interact with FAS and has been implicated in the regulation of FAS-mediated apoptosis.

8. TBX3 (T-box transcription factor TBX3) is involved in the regulation of development and has been implicated in apoptosis through its ability to repress the expression of pro-apoptotic genes.

9. TP53 (tumor protein p53) is a well-known tumor suppressor and transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the response to DNA damage and stress, leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence, or apoptosis. It can induce the expression of several pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and is a key regulator of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the regulation of apoptosis, with a focus on the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The Bcl-2 family members control mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, while CASP8 and FAS are central to death receptor-mediated apoptosis. IFNGR1, PARP1, PTPN13, TBX3, and TP53 are involved in modulating these pathways or are affected by them. The interplay between these proteins ensures the proper execution of apoptosis, which is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing the development of diseases such as cancer."	0.92	0.0	5/16	2.1005823832523369e-13	4.94517919772065e-11	BCL2;FAS;BCL2L2;BCL2L1;MCL1	Extrinsic Apoptotic Signaling Pathway In Absence Of Ligand 	GO:0097192	0	0.9151031	0.55392826	LLM	"1.

The proteins BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BLM, WRN, RAD51, RAD51C, FANCD2, MSH2, and MSH6 are central to the DNA damage response (DDR) and repair pathways. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are particularly known for their roles in homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks. BLM and WRN helicases resolve DNA secondary structures, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. The MSH2 and MSH6 proteins are part of the mismatch repair system, correcting base-pairing errors post-DNA replication.

2. The proteins BUB1B, CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CCNE2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, CDKN1C, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, CHEK1, CKS1B, E2F1, E2F4, RB1, RBL1, and RBL2 are involved in cell cycle regulation. Cyclins (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CCNE2) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4, CDK5, CDK6) drive the cell cycle progression, while CDK inhibitors (CDKN1A, CDKN1B, CDKN1C, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C) and checkpoint kinases like CHEK1 provide negative regulation. The RB1 protein and its related RBL1 and RBL2 are key in controlling the G1 to S phase transition, often through interactions with E2F transcription factors.

3. The proteins CREBBP, EP300, HDAC1, and MYC are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. CREBBP and EP300 are histone acetyltransferases that modify chromatin structure to regulate gene expression, while HDAC1 is involved in the opposite process, histone deacetylation. MYC is a well-known transcription factor that controls the expression of numerous genes involved in cell growth and proliferation.

4. The protein TP53, also known as p53, is a tumor suppressor that plays a critical role in preventing cancer formation. It can induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or senescence in response to DNA damage or other stress signals. TP53 works in concert with other proteins in this system to maintain genomic integrity and respond to cellular stress.

5. TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, is involved in the maintenance of telomeres, which are essential for chromosomal stability and cellular immortality. Its activity is tightly regulated and often repressed in somatic cells, but it can be reactivated in cancer cells.

The proteins BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BLM, WRN, RAD51, RAD51C, FANCD2, MSH2, and MSH6 are central to the DNA damage response (DDR) and repair pathways. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are particularly known for their roles in homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks. BLM and WRN helicases resolve DNA secondary structures, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. The MSH2 and MSH6 proteins are part of the mismatch repair system, correcting base-pairing errors post-DNA replication.[1][2][3][4]

2. The proteins BUB1B, CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CCNE2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, CDKN1C, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, CHEK1, CKS1B, E2F1, E2F4, RB1, RBL1, and RBL2 are involved in cell cycle regulation. Cyclins (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CCNE2) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4, CDK5, CDK6) drive the cell cycle progression, while CDK inhibitors (CDKN1A, CDKN1B, CDKN1C, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C) and checkpoint kinases like CHEK1 provide negative regulation. The RB1 protein and its related RBL1 and RBL2 are key in controlling the G1 to S phase transition, often through interactions with E2F transcription factors.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]

3. The proteins CREBBP, EP300, HDAC1, and MYC are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. CREBBP and EP300 are histone acetyltransferases that modify chromatin structure to regulate gene expression, while HDAC1 is involved in the opposite process, histone deacetylation. MYC is a well-known transcription factor that controls the expression of numerous genes involved in cell growth and proliferation.[15][16]

4. The protein TP53, also known as p53, is a tumor suppressor that plays a critical role in preventing cancer formation. It can induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or senescence in response to DNA damage or other stress signals.

AURKA (Aurora kinase A) and AURKB (Aurora kinase B) are serine/threonine kinases that play critical roles in the regulation of mitosis. AURKA is involved in centrosome maturation and separation, spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation, while AURKB is essential for chromosome condensation, spindle assembly checkpoint function, and cytokinesis. Both kinases are crucial for accurate chromosomal segregation and the maintenance of genomic stability during cell division.

2. BUB1B (BUBR1) is a key component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which ensures proper chromosome alignment and segregation before anaphase onset. It inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the spindle, preventing aneuploidy and contributing to genomic integrity.

3. CHEK1 (Checkpoint kinase 1) is a central player in the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoints. It is activated in response to replication stress and DNA damage, leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis if the damage is irreparable. CHEK1 coordinates with other proteins to maintain genomic stability by preventing the entry into mitosis with damaged DNA.

4. MKI67 (Marker of proliferation Ki-67) is a nuclear protein associated with cellular proliferation. It is present during all active phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and M), but is absent in resting (G0) cells. MKI67 is a marker for cell proliferation and is often used to assess the growth fraction of cells in neoplasms.

5. RAD51 is a key protein in homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks. During the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, RAD51 facilitates strand invasion and exchange between homologous chromosomes, which is essential for error-free DNA repair and the prevention of mutations that could lead to cancer.

6. TOP2A (DNA topoisomerase II alpha) is an enzyme that alters the topological states of DNA during transcription, replication, and chromosome segregation. It is essential for resolving DNA supercoiling and tangling that occurs during these processes. TOP2A is particularly important during the mitotic phase to ensure proper condensation and segregation of chromosomes.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the regulation of the mitotic cell cycle and the maintenance of genomic stability. They work in concert to ensure accurate DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and cell division, while also responding to DNA damage and stress to prevent the propagation of genomic errors. The interplay between these proteins is critical for the fidelity of cell division and the prevention of oncogenic transformations."	0.95	0.0	4/130	5.8746793562376646e-08	9.751967731354524e-06	CHEK1;MKI67;AURKB;AURKA	Regulation Of Cell Cycle Process 	GO:0010564	0	0.49668294	0.25601375	LLM	"1. AURKA (Aurora kinase A) and AURKB (Aurora kinase B) are serine/threonine kinases that play critical roles in the regulation of mitosis. AURKA is involved in centrosome maturation and separation, spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation, while AURKB is essential for chromosome condensation, spindle assembly checkpoint function, and cytokinesis. Both kinases are crucial for accurate chromosomal segregation and the maintenance of genomic stability during cell division.[1]

2. BUB1B (BUBR1) is a key component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which ensures proper chromosome alignment and segregation before anaphase onset. It inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the spindle, preventing aneuploidy and contributing to genomic integrity.

3. CHEK1 (Checkpoint kinase 1) is a central player in the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoints. It is activated in response to replication stress and DNA damage, leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis if the damage is irreparable. CHEK1 coordinates with other proteins to maintain genomic stability by preventing the entry into mitosis with damaged DNA.

4. MKI67 (Marker of proliferation Ki-67) is a nuclear protein associated with cellular proliferation. It is present during all active phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and M), but is absent in resting (G0) cells. MKI67 is a marker for cell proliferation and is often used to assess the growth fraction of cells in neoplasms.

5. RAD51 is a key protein in homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks. During the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, RAD51 facilitates strand invasion and exchange between homologous chromosomes, which is essential for error-free DNA repair and the prevention of mutations that could lead to cancer.

CUL3 is a core component of multiple cullin-RING-based E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes that mediate the ubiquitination of proteins destined for degradation through the 26S proteasome. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle control, signal transduction, and gene expression.

2. DDB2 is part of the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein complex, which participates in nucleotide excision repair (NER). It is also known to be involved in the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, contributing to the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of proteins involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation.

3. ELOC, also known as elongin C, is a subunit of the elongin complex that increases the rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. It is also a part of the VHL (von Hippel-Lindau) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for degradation under normoxic conditions.

4. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates the p53 tumor suppressor. It ubiquitinates p53, leading to its degradation, and thus controls cell cycle progression and apoptosis. MDM2 itself is regulated by various proteins and can also ubiquitinate other substrates.

5. NF2, also known as merlin, is a tumor suppressor protein that regulates cell growth and proliferation. It is involved in signaling pathways that control contact inhibition and is implicated in the localization of proteins to the cell membrane.

6. STK11, also known as LKB1, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and is a major upstream kinase for the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which is important for cellular energy homeostasis.

7. TET2 is involved in the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in DNA, which is a part of the active DNA demethylation pathway. It plays a role in gene regulation and is implicated in hematopoietic differentiation.

8. VHL is part of the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets HIF for proteasomal degradation. Mutations in VHL can lead to the development of tumors due to the accumulation of HIF and the activation of genes that promote angiogenesis and cellular growth.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of protein stability through ubiquitination, impacting various cellular processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle control, and response to hypoxia.

The proteins ATM, ATR, CHEK1, and TP53 are central to the DNA damage response (DDR). ATM and ATR are serine/threonine-protein kinases that activate checkpoint signaling upon double-strand breaks (DSBs) and replication stress, respectively. CHEK1 is a checkpoint kinase activated by ATR, while TP53, the tumor suppressor protein p53, is activated by ATM and functions to induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis.

2. BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3 are involved in homologous recombination (HR), a high-fidelity DNA repair process for DSBs. BRCA1 and BRCA2 facilitate RAD51 filament formation on DNA, which is essential for strand invasion during HR. PALB2 acts as a bridge between BRCA1 and BRCA2, stabilizing their interaction.

3. BARD1 forms a heterodimer with BRCA1, which is involved in DNA repair, ubiquitination, and checkpoint control. BLM and WRN, both RecQ helicases, are involved in DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Mutations in these genes are associated with Bloom and Werner syndromes, respectively, which are characterized by genomic instability.

4. MRE11, RAD50, and NBN (NBS1) form the MRN complex, which is critical for the detection of DSBs and the initiation of DDR. FANCA and FANCD2 are part of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is important for the repair of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) in DNA.

5. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates the p53 pathway by targeting it for degradation. CDC73 is a component of the PAF1 complex, which has been implicated in the regulation of DDR and maintenance of genome integrity.

6. BUB1B is a kinase involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint during mitosis, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and preventing aneuploidy. POLH is a translesion synthesis DNA polymerase that allows DNA replication to bypass lesions.

7. TOP2A is a DNA topoisomerase that controls and alters the topologic states of DNA during transcription. It is also a target for anticancer drugs that induce DNA damage.

8. MDC1 is a mediator of the DDR, functioning as a scaffold for the accumulation of repair proteins at the site of damage.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in the detection, signaling, and repair of DNA damage, with a focus on maintaining genomic stability. The system includes proteins that sense DNA damage, signal its presence, and execute repair processes such as homologous recombination and the repair of interstrand crosslinks. The interplay between these proteins ensures the integrity of the genome during cell division and in response to genotoxic stress."	1.0	0.0	21/291	4.898459193609726e-33	2.2385958514796447e-30	BARD1;BLM;MRE11;XRCC2;XRCC3;FANCA;BRCA1;BRCA2;RAD51B;MSH6;RAD50;RAD51D;WRN;RAD51C;RAD51;FANCD2;CHEK1;ATM;NBN;TP53;POLH	DNA Repair 	GO:0006281	0	0.706776	0.60284907	LLM	"1.

These proteins can be grouped based on their roles in immune cell signaling, antigen processing and presentation, and immune checkpoints.

1. Immune Cell Signaling: Proteins such as BTK, SYK, LYN, FYN, CARD11, and the CD19, CD79A, and CD79B complex are critical components of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. They play essential roles in B-cell development, activation, and differentiation. JAK2, JAK3, STAT4, and STAT5A are involved in cytokine receptor signaling, which is crucial for immune cell proliferation and function.

2. Antigen Processing and Presentation: The large set of HLA proteins (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DMA, HLA-DMB, HLA-DOA, HLA-DOB, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQB2, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB5, HLA-E, HLA-F, HLA-G) are involved in the presentation of peptide antigens to T cells, a process essential for adaptive immunity. TAP1 and TAP2 are transporter proteins that play a role in the delivery of peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto HLA class I molecules.

3. Immune Checkpoints: Proteins such as CTLA4, PDCD1 (PD-1), CD274 (PD-L1), PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2), LAG3, and TIGIT are immune checkpoint molecules that regulate the amplitude and duration of immune responses. They are critical for maintaining self-tolerance and modulating the immune response to prevent tissue damage.

4. Cytokine Signaling and Receptors: Proteins like IL2RA, IL6R, IL7R, IL10RA, CSF1R, CSF3R, IFNGR2, and TNFRSF members (TNFRSF14, TNFRSF17, TNFRSF9) are receptors for cytokines and growth factors that regulate immune cell growth, differentiation, and response to inflammation or infection.

5. Inflammation and Cell Survival: Proteins such as NFKBIA, TNFAIP3, and BIRC3 are involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is pivotal in regulating inflammation, cell survival, and apoptosis. FAS and PRF1 are involved in the induction of apoptosis, contributing to the elimination of infected or transformed cells.

6. Additional Regulatory Proteins: IDO1 and AXL are examples of proteins that modulate the immune response. IDO1 is involved in tryptophan catabolism, which can suppress T-cell responses and promote immune tolerance. AXL is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can inhibit the activation of the innate immune response.

In summary, the proteins in this system work together to modulate immune responses, ensuring that the body can effectively respond to pathogens while avoiding autoimmunity. The system is characterized by a complex interplay between signaling pathways that activate immune cells, mechanisms that present antigens to T cells, and checkpoints that prevent overactivation of the immune system.

BIRC3 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 3), also known as cIAP2, is an inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP). It functions by binding to caspases and inhibiting their activity, thus preventing apoptosis. BIRC3 also plays a role in the activation of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling pathway, which is involved in cell survival, proliferation, and inflammation.

2. CASP8 (Caspase 8) is an initiator caspase in the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. It is activated by death receptors such as FAS, and once activated, it can cleave and activate downstream effector caspases, leading to apoptosis. CASP8 also has a role in activating NF-κB through the cleavage of RIPK1 in complex I of the TNF receptor signaling complex.

3. CD40 is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily and is involved in the activation and survival of B cells. The interaction of CD40 with its ligand leads to the activation of MAP3K7 and TRAF proteins, which are important for NF-κB signaling and can also influence apoptosis.

4. FAS (also known as CD95) is a death receptor that, upon binding with its ligand FASLG, initiates the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. It activates CASP8, which in turn activates downstream caspases.

5. MAP3K7 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase 7), also known as TAK1, is involved in the activation of NF-κB and JNK/p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF.

6. PARP1 (Poly [ADP-ribose] Polymerase 1) is involved in DNA repair and can also play a role in the regulation of apoptosis. It is a substrate for CASP8 and can be cleaved during apoptosis.

7. TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that can induce apoptosis through its receptors. It also activates NF-κB signaling, which can promote cell survival and inflammation.

8. TNFAIP3 (TNF Alpha Induced Protein 3), also known as A20, is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that negatively regulates NF-κB signaling by modifying TRAF proteins and inhibiting their ability to activate NF-κB.

9. TNFRSF9 (TNF Receptor Superfamily Member 9), also known as CD137 or 4-1BB, is a co-stimulatory molecule that can enhance T cell proliferation and survival. It can also influence NF-κB signaling.

10. TP53 (Tumor Protein p53) is a well-known tumor suppressor that regulates the cell cycle and can induce apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

11. TRAF2 (TNF Receptor Associated Factor 2) and TRAF3 are adaptor proteins that mediate signal transduction from TNF receptors, leading to the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases. They can also modulate apoptosis.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of apoptosis and NF-κB signaling. These processes are tightly interconnected, with several proteins such as BIRC3, CASP8, and TNF playing dual roles in promoting cell survival through NF-κB activation and in mediating apoptosis. The balance between these opposing outcomes is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress signals. The system reflects a complex network where extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways intersect with cell survival and inflammatory signaling pathways."	0.92	0.0	9/232	6.94543135697739e-16	4.1950405396143444e-13	CD40;CASP8;PARP1;TRAF3;TNFAIP3;TRAF2;TNF;MAP3K7;BIRC3	Regulation Of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB Signaling 	GO:0043122	0	0.6315342	0.5069334	LLM	"1.

3. CD40 is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily and is involved in the activation and survival of B cells. The interaction of CD40 with its ligand leads to the activation of MAP3K7 and TRAF proteins, which are important for NF-κB signaling and can also influence apoptosis.[2][3]

4. FAS (also known as CD95) is a death receptor that, upon binding with its ligand FASLG, initiates the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. It activates CASP8, which in turn activates downstream caspases.[4]

5. MAP3K7 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase 7), also known as TAK1, is involved in the activation of NF-κB and JNK/p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF.[5]

6. PARP1 (Poly [ADP-ribose] Polymerase 1) is involved in DNA repair and can also play a role in the regulation of apoptosis. It is a substrate for CASP8 and can be cleaved during apoptosis.

7. TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that can induce apoptosis through its receptors. It also activates NF-κB signaling, which can promote cell survival and inflammation.[6]

8. TNFAIP3 (TNF Alpha Induced Protein 3), also known as A20, is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that negatively regulates NF-κB signaling by modifying TRAF proteins and inhibiting their ability to activate NF-κB.

9. TNFRSF9 (TNF Receptor Superfamily Member 9), also known as CD137 or 4-1BB, is a co-stimulatory molecule that can enhance T cell proliferation and survival. It can also influence NF-κB signaling.

10. TP53 (Tumor Protein p53) is a well-known tumor suppressor that regulates the cell cycle and can induce apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

11. TRAF2 (TNF Receptor Associated Factor 2) and TRAF3 are adaptor proteins that mediate signal transduction from TNF receptors, leading to the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases. They can also modulate apoptosis.[7]

To summarize, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of apoptosis and NF-κB signaling. These processes are tightly interconnected, with several proteins such as BIRC3, CASP8, and TNF playing dual roles in promoting cell survival through NF-κB activation and in mediating apoptosis. The balance between these opposing outcomes is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress signals. The system reflects a complex network where extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways intersect with cell survival and inflammatory signaling pathways.[8][9]

The interplay between these proteins contributes to the precise spatial organization of cells during development, particularly in the nervous system, where they help establish the intricate patterns of neuronal connections. The presence of PTPRD and SLIT2 suggests a regulatory integration with the Eph-ephrin system, modulating the signaling for proper neural network formation and maintenance.

6. Exosome components (RRP40, RRP46) and other RNA processing factors (RCL1, RIOK1, RIOK2) contribute to the maturation of rRNA by degrading incorrectly processed rRNA precursors and other RNA species that are not properly assembled into ribosomal subunits.

CHMP3 (Charged Multivesicular Body Protein 3) and CHMP6 are components of the ESCRT-III complex (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport III), which is crucial for the sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These proteins are involved in the late stages of cytokinesis and are essential for the final abscission step of cell division. They also play a role in the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) within MVBs, a process important for the degradation of membrane proteins.

2. ATP6V1B2 is a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) proton pump, which acidifies a variety of intracellular compartments, including endosomes, lysosomes, and the Golgi apparatus. This acidification is necessary for the proper sorting of cargo proteins to lysosomes and for the activation of lysosomal enzymes. The function of V-ATPase is also critical for the endocytic and autophagic pathways.

3. TSG101 (Tumor Susceptibility Gene 101) and VPS28 are components of the ESCRT-I complex, which is involved in the recognition and sequestration of ubiquitinated cargo proteins into MVBs. TSG101 is essential for MVB biogenesis and for the sorting of cargo proteins into ILVs. VPS28, along with other ESCRT-I components, recruits downstream ESCRT machinery and is necessary for the progression of the MVB pathway.

4. GLUL (Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glutamate and ammonia to glutamine.

4. BRIX1 is involved in ribosome biogenesis, but its interaction with the Mediator complex components could suggest a link between transcription regulation and ribosomal RNA synthesis, although this is not a primary function of the proteins listed.

5. TMX2 is a transmembrane protein that may be involved in the regulation of cellular processes, but its direct connection to the Mediator complex and transcription regulation is not well established.

6. ZDHHC7, ADAM10, EPS8L1, FAM136A, and POGLUT3 are proteins with various functions, such as palmitoyltransferase activity, protease function, actin remodeling, and protein glycosylation, respectively. Their connection to the Mediator complex and transcription regulation is not immediately clear from the information provided.

In conclusion, the predominant biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the assembly and function of the Mediator complex in transcription regulation. While some proteins in the list have functions that are not directly related to transcription, the overwhelming majority are integral components of the Mediator complex, which is central to the regulation of gene expression. The presence of SUPT6H suggests a link between Mediator function and chromatin organization. The inclusion of BRIX1, although primarily associated with ribosome biogenesis, may indicate a broader regulatory role that could intersect with transcription. The roles of ZDHHC7, ADAM10, EPS8L1, FAM136A, and POGLUT3 in this context are less clear, and further investigation would be required to elucidate their potential involvement in transcription regulation or their interaction with the Mediator complex.

GLRX3, also known as Glutaredoxin 3, is part of the glutaredoxin family, which plays a crucial role in cellular redox homeostasis. It functions as an antioxidant by facilitating the reduction of other proteins by cysteine thiol-disulfide exchange, thereby protecting cells against oxidative stress. GLRX3 is also known to be involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and may play a role in the regulation of transcription factors like NF-kB in response to oxidative stress.

2. KEAP1, or Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, is a substrate adaptor protein for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets the transcription factor Nrf2 for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Under oxidative stress conditions, modifications in KEAP1 allow Nrf2 to escape degradation, leading to its accumulation and translocation into the nucleus where it activates the transcription of antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven genes. This process is a key regulatory mechanism of the cellular antioxidant defense system.

3. NAA30, a subunit of the N-terminal acetyltransferase C (NatC) complex, is involved in the co-translational acetylation of the N-termini of proteins. This modification can affect protein folding, stability, and interactions, and is important for the normal functioning of a wide range of cellular proteins.

4. NAA35 is another component of the NatC complex, which works in conjunction with NAA30 to facilitate N-terminal acetylation of proteins. The activity of the NatC complex is essential for the regulation of protein function and stability, and it has been implicated in various cellular processes including cell cycle progression and apoptosis.

In summary, the proteins in this set are involved in two main biological processes: the regulation of cellular redox homeostasis and protein N-terminal acetylation. GLRX3 and KEAP1 are key players in the cellular response to oxidative stress, with KEAP1 acting as a sensor and regulator of the antioxidant response through its interaction with Nrf2. On the other hand, NAA30 and NAA35 are components of the NatC complex, which is responsible for the co-translational modification of proteins, influencing their function and stability. The interplay between these proteins suggests a system that is tightly regulated to maintain cellular homeostasis under varying conditions of stress and protein synthesis."	0.85	0.0	2/7	6.29760247973613e-07	2.078208818312923e-05	NAA30;NAA35	N-terminal Peptidyl-Methionine Acetylation 	GO:0017196	0	0.48532534	0.53944796	GO	"1.

PCNX3, or Pecanex-like protein 3, is a transmembrane protein that is less characterized in the context of SUMOylation. However, it has been implicated in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway, which is known to be modulated by post-translational modifications, including SUMOylation. Its role in this protein system may be as a regulatory factor influenced by SUMOylation, affecting gene expression and cellular differentiation processes.

2. PIAS1, or Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT 1, functions as an E3 SUMO-protein ligase, mediating the attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to target substrates. This modification can alter the activity of proteins, their stability, and their interaction with other molecules, often resulting in the repression of transcriptional activity. PIAS1 is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction.

3. SAE1, or SUMO-activating enzyme subunit 1, together with UBA2 (SUMO-activating enzyme subunit 2), forms the heterodimeric SUMO-activating enzyme (E1). This enzyme is responsible for the initial step in the SUMOylation pathway, activating the SUMO protein in an ATP-dependent manner. This activation is necessary for the SUMO protein to be subsequently transferred to target substrates.

4. UBA2, as mentioned above, partners with SAE1 to form the E1 enzyme complex essential for SUMO activation. The SAE1-UBA2 complex facilitates the first step in the SUMO conjugation cascade, which is critical for the regulation of protein function and localization.

5. UBE2I, also known as UBC9, is the sole E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme and is central to the SUMOylation process. It accepts activated SUMO from the E1 complex and transfers it to lysine residues on substrate proteins, often with the assistance of an E3 ligase such as PIAS1. UBE2I is crucial for the conjugation of SUMO to a variety of proteins involved in numerous cellular processes, including nuclear transport, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and protein stability.

In summary, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in the SUMOylation pathway, a post-translational modification process that modulates the function of proteins, particularly in the context of transcriptional regulation. The system includes the full set of enzymes required for SUMO activation (SAE1 and UBA2), conjugation (UBE2I), and substrate modification (PIAS1), with PCNX3 potentially being a target or regulator of SUMOylation.

CAD is a multifunctional protein that catalyzes the first three steps of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. This includes the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate, the conversion to carbamoyl aspartate, and the cyclization to dihydroorotate. These reactions are critical for the production of the pyrimidine nucleotides UTP and CTP, which are essential for RNA and DNA synthesis.

2. DHODH, or dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, is an enzyme that links pyrimidine biosynthesis to the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It catalyzes the fourth step in de novo pyrimidine synthesis, the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate. This reaction occurs at the mitochondrial inner membrane and involves the transfer of electrons to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q), contributing to the proton gradient used for ATP synthesis.

3. SDHA and SDHC are components of succinate dehydrogenase, also known as complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. SDHA is the flavoprotein subunit that catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the Krebs cycle, while SDHC is a membrane anchor that helps form the electron transfer pathway to ubiquinone. The activity of complex II is integral to both energy production and the regulation of metabolic pathways.

It catalyzes the final two steps of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, converting orotate to UMP, which is subsequently phosphorylated to form the nucleotides UTP and CTP.

CTU1 (Cytoplasmic tRNA 2-thiolation protein 1) and CTU2 (Cytoplasmic tRNA 2-thiolation protein 2) are part of the cytoplasmic tRNA thiolation complex. They are involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA, specifically in the thiolation of uridine residues at the wobble position of tRNAs. This modification is crucial for the accurate decoding of the genetic code during protein synthesis and for the stabilization of tRNA structure.

2. ELP3 (Elongator complex protein 3) is a catalytic subunit of the Elongator complex, which is involved in the modification of wobble base uridines to 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm5U) and 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U). These modifications are important for the proper codon-anticodon pairing during translation and for the overall fidelity of protein synthesis.

3. ELP4 (Elongator complex protein 4) and ELP5 (Elongator complex protein 5) are also components of the Elongator complex. They play a role in the assembly and stability of the complex, which is essential for its function in tRNA modification. The Elongator complex has additional roles in transcriptional regulation, exocytosis, and possibly other cellular processes.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are primarily involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules, which is essential for the accuracy and efficiency of translation. The CTU1 and CTU2 proteins work in concert with the Elongator complex, which includes ELP3, ELP4, and ELP5, to ensure that tRNAs are properly modified. These modifications are critical for the recognition of specific codons during the synthesis of proteins, thereby influencing the rate and fidelity of translation.

DAD1, Defender Against Cell Death 1, is a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which catalyzes the transfer of a pre-assembled oligosaccharide onto asparagine residues in nascent polypeptide chains, a process known as N-glycosylation. This modification is crucial for protein folding and stability.

2. DDOST, Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase subunit, is another component of the OST complex, working in concert with DAD1 and other subunits to ensure proper glycosylation of proteins during their translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

3. DHDDS, Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase, is involved in the synthesis of dolichol phosphate, a lipid carrier molecule used in the N-glycosylation of proteins. This step is essential for the assembly of the oligosaccharide precursor used by OST.

4. ALG2, Asparagine-linked glycosylation 2, is a calcium-binding protein that is part of the glycosylation pathway, specifically involved in the early steps of synthesizing the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor.

5. SEC61A1 and SEC61G are components of the Sec61 translocon complex, which is responsible for the translocation of nascent polypeptides into the ER lumen. This complex forms a channel through which the polypeptides are threaded and allows for the concurrent N-glycosylation of the nascent chains.

6. SRP19, SRP68, SRP72, and SRP9 are components of the signal recognition particle (SRP), which recognizes and targets specific protein sequences to the ER membrane. SRP is essential for the co-translational targeting of proteins to the Sec61 translocon.

7. SRPRB, Signal Recognition Particle Receptor B, is part of the SRP receptor, which interacts with the SRP to dock the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the Sec61 translocon, facilitating the entry of the nascent polypeptide into the ER for processing and folding.

In summary, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in the co-translational translocation of nascent polypeptides into the ER and their subsequent N-glycosylation.
