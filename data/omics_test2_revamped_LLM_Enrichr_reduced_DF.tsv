To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the cellular stress response, regulation of cell proliferation, and tumor suppression. They interact in networks that govern cell fate decisions in response to stress and damage, and many have roles in preventing the development of cancer through various mechanisms including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis. The prominence of these functions among the proteins listed justifies the process name ""Cellular Stress Response and Tumor Suppression."" The confidence score reflects the fact that while many proteins contribute to this process, not all are directly involved, and some may participate in related but distinct cellular functions."	0.85	0	19/1243	3.901410713583319e-07	0.0004135495356398318	EIF5A;CEBPA;JUN;JAG1;SMARCD3;PRKDC;HEATR1;RRP1B;SMARCA1;FOXO3;ETS2;VEGFA;NFKBIA;RGCC;MYC;NUP62;SOX9;TP53;MET	Positive Regulation
