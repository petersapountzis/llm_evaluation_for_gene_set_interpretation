Base your analysis on prior knowledge available in your training data.\n\nThen, based on your analysis, propose a brief and detailed name for the most prominent biological process performed by the system.\n    \n\nAlso based on your analysis, provide a confidence score for your chosen name and put it after the name in parenthesis. The confidence score should be a number between 0.00 and 1.00, where 0.00 means that your confidence is lowest and 1.00 means that your confidence is highest.\nBasically, with this score you indicate how well your chosen process name describes the functions and processes of the system of interacting proteins.\nWhen computing the score, you must also take into account 'how many' genes in the system of proteins are actually involved in that biological process. For example, if you choose 'Ribosome biogenesis' as process name and only a few genes in the system are involved in this process, your score should be lower than it would be if most of the genes in the system were involved.\n     \nPut your chosen name at the top of the analysis as 'Process: <name>\u2019.\n    \nBe concise, do not use unnecessary words.\nBe factual, do not editorialize.\nBe specific, avoid overly general statements such as 'the proteins are involved in various cellular processes\u2019. Also avoid choosing generic process names such as \u2018Cellular Signaling and Regulation'.\n\nIf you cannot identify a prominent biological process for the majority of the proteins in the system, I want you to communicate this in you analysis and name the process: \u201cSystem of unrelated proteins\u201d.\nProvide a score of 0.00 for a \"system of unrelated proteins\".\n    \nTo help you in your work, I am providing an example system of interacting proteins and the corresponding example analysis output.\n\nThe example system of interacting proteins is:\nPDX1, SLC2A2, NKX6-1, GLP1, GCG.\n\nThe example analysis output is:\n\nProcess: Pancreatic development and glucose homeostasis (0.96)\n\n1. PDX1 is a homeodomain transcription factor involved in the specification of the early pancreatic epithelium and its subsequent differentiation. It activates the transcription of several genes including insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase and glucose transporter type 2. It is essential for maintenance of the normal hormone-producing phenotype in the pancreatic beta-cell. In pancreatic acinar cells, forms a complex with PBX1b and MEIS2b and mediates the activation of the ELA1 enhancer.\n\n2. NKX6-1 is also a transcription factor involved in the development of pancreatic beta-cells during the secondary transition. Together with NKX2-2 and IRX3, controls the generation of motor neurons in the neural tube and belongs to the neural progenitor factors induced by Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signals.\n\n3.GCG and GLP1, respectively glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1, are involved in glucose metabolism and homeostasis. GCG raises blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and is the counter regulatory hormone of Insulin. GLP1 is a potent stimulator of Glucose-Induced Insulin Secretion (GSIS). Plays roles in gastric motility and suppresses blood glucagon levels. Promotes growth of the intestinal epithelium and pancreatic islet mass both by islet neogenesis and islet cell proliferation.\n\n4. SLC2A2, also known as GLUT2, is a facilitative hexose transporter. In hepatocytes, it mediates bi-directional transport of glucose accross the plasma membranes, while in the pancreatic beta-cell, it is the main transporter responsible for glucose uptake and part of the cell's glucose-sensing mechanism. It is involved in glucose transport in the small intestine and kidney too.\n\nTo summarize, the genes in this set are involved in the specification, differentiation, growth and functionality of the pancreas, with a particular emphasis on the pancreatic beta-cell. Particularly, the architecture of the pancreatic islet ensures proper glucose sensing and homeostasis via a number of different hormones and receptors that can elicit both synergistic and antagonistic effects in the pancreas itself and other peripheral tissues.\n\n    \n\nHere are the interacting proteins:\n\nProteins: LRSAM1, MARK4, MXRA5, FERMT1, GCM2, SPDYC.\n\n", "responses": "System of unrelated proteins\n0.00\n1. LRSAM1 (Leucine-rich repeat and sterile alpha motif-containing protein 1) is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. It is associated with the regulation of sorting and degradation of cell surface receptors and plays a role in the regulation of immune responses.\n\n2. MARK4 (Microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4) is a kinase involved in cell polarity, microtubule stabilization, and possibly in the development of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. It phosphorylates microtubule-associated proteins and may be involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics.\n\n3. MXRA5 (Matrix-remodeling associated 5) is a protein that may be involved in tissue remodeling and angiogenesis. It is associated with extracellular matrix organization and has been implicated in processes such as wound healing.\n\n4. FERMT1 (Fermitin family homolog 1), also known as kindlin-1, is involved in integrin activation and cell-matrix adhesions. It plays a role in the regulation of cell spreading, migration, and differentiation, particularly in the context of epithelial cells.\n\n5. GCM2 (Glial cells missing homolog 2) is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of parathyroid gland development and the maintenance of parathyroid hormone production. It is critical for the development of the parathyroid glands and the regulation of calcium homeostasis.\n\n6. SPDYC (Speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member C) is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. It can promote cell cycle progression and has been implicated in the control of the G1/S transition.\n\nThe proteins listed are involved in a diverse array of biological processes, including ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, microtubule dynamics, tissue remodeling, cell adhesion, parathyroid gland development, and cell cycle regulation. There is no single, prominent biological process that encompasses the majority of these proteins. Therefore, this system of interacting proteins does not appear to be centered around a common biological theme or pathway, and the proteins seem to be involved in unrelated biological processes.", "finger_print": "fp_6aca3b5ce1"}}}
