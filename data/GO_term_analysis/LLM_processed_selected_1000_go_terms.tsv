2. NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are another group of PRRs involved in the innate immune response. In this system, NLRP1, NLRP2B, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRP10, NLRC4, and NLRC5 are present. These proteins form inflammasomes, which are multiprotein complexes that activate caspase-1, leading to the processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18.

3. C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are also involved in the innate immune response. In this system, CLEC4E, CLEC6A, and CLEC7A are present. These proteins recognize carbohydrate structures on pathogens and initiate signaling pathways that lead to the activation of immune cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

4. Several proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of cytokine production and signaling. For example, IL12A and IL12B are subunits of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12, which is involved in the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. IL17A and IL17F are pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection.

5. The system also includes proteins involved in the regulation of immune cell activation and function. For example, CD40 is a co-stimulatory molecule that plays a role in the activation of B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. CD226 is involved in the activation of NK cells and T cells, while CD274 (PD-L1) is an immune checkpoint molecule that negatively regulates T cell activation.

6. Several proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways that control the immune response. For example, IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAK3, and IRAK4 are involved in TLR signaling, while TBK1 and IKBKB are involved in the activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, which regulate the expression of immune response genes.

7. The system also includes proteins involved in the regulation of cell death and inflammation. For example, XIAP is an inhibitor of apoptosis, while FADD is involved in the activation of caspase-8, which initiates the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. CASP1 and CASP6 are involved in the regulation of inflammation and cell death.

In conclusion, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in the regulation of the innate immune response, with a focus on the recognition of pathogens, the activation of immune cells, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the regulation of cell death and inflammation."	0.11801242236024845	38

This pathway is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The Wnt signaling pathway is initiated by the binding of Wnt ligands (e.g., WNT5A) to Frizzled receptors (e.g., FZD4, FZD5, FZD8, FZD10) and co-receptors (e.g., LRP5/6, ROR2). This binding activates the downstream signaling cascade, which involves the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin (CTNNB1) and the activation of target genes.

Key proteins involved in the Wnt signaling pathway include:

1. WNT5A: A Wnt ligand that binds to Frizzled receptors and activates the pathway.
2. FZD4, FZD5, FZD8, FZD10: Frizzled receptors that bind Wnt ligands and initiate the signaling cascade.
3. ROR2: A co-receptor that interacts with Frizzled receptors and Wnt ligands to modulate the pathway.
4. AXIN1: A scaffold protein that forms a complex with β-catenin, GSK3β, and APC, regulating β-catenin stability.
5. DVL2, DVL3: Dishevelled proteins that transduce the signal from Frizzled receptors to downstream components.
6. RAF1: A kinase that can modulate the Wnt signaling pathway through the regulation of β-catenin phosphorylation.
7. AKT1: A kinase that can phosphorylate and inactivate GSK3β, leading to the stabilization of β-catenin.
8. TCF/LEF: Transcription factors that interact with β-catenin to activate target gene expression.

The Wnt signaling pathway is regulated by various proteins, including:

1. DKK1: An antagonist that binds to LRP5/6 and inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway.
2. SIRT1: A deacetylase that can modulate the Wnt signaling pathway by deacetylating β-catenin.
3. TAOK1, TAOK2, TAOK3: Kinases that can phosphorylate and activate TAK1, which in turn modulates the Wnt signaling pathway.

The Wnt signaling pathway interacts with other signaling pathways, such as:

1. TGF-β signaling pathway: TGFB1, a ligand in the TGF-β signaling pathway, can modulate the Wnt signaling pathway by regulating the expression of Wnt ligands and antagonists.
2. MAPK signaling pathway: MAP2K1, MAP2K2, MAP2K5, MAP2K6, and MAP2K7 are kinases involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, which can cross-talk with the Wnt signaling pathway.
3. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway: PIK3CA, PIK3CG, PIK3R1, PIK3R5, and PIK3R6 are components of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which can modulate the Wnt signaling pathway through the regulation of GSK3β activity.

In conclusion, the Wnt signaling pathway is a crucial biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins, regulating various cellular processes and interacting with other signaling pathways."	0.11894273127753303	27

Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that play a crucial role in the innate immune response, particularly in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).

Key proteins involved in inflammasome activation include NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRP7, NLRP10, NLRP12, NLRC4, AIM2, and PYCARD. These proteins are part of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family and the AIM2-like receptor (ALR) family, which are responsible for sensing intracellular danger signals and initiating the assembly of inflammasomes. The activation of these proteins leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein PYCARD (also known as ASC), which in turn recruits and activates caspase-1 (CASP1). Active caspase-1 then cleaves pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18, into their mature forms, leading to an inflammatory response.

Several proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of inflammasome activation. For example, TNFAIP3, also known as A20, is a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of NLRP3. Additionally, IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18.

Other proteins in this system are involved in the recognition of PAMPs and DAMPs, such as TLR4, TLR6, and TLR8, which are part of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. These proteins recognize extracellular and endosomal PAMPs and DAMPs, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which contribute to the transcriptional regulation of inflammasome components.

Furthermore, several proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of cell death, such as CASP8, which can cleave and inactivate the gasdermin D protein (GSDMD), preventing pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death associated with inflammasome activation.

In summary, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in the activation and regulation of inflammasomes, which play a crucial role in the innate immune response to PAMPs and DAMPs. Key proteins in this system include NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRP7, NLRP10, NLRP12, NLRC4, AIM2, PYCARD, CASP1, TNFAIP3, IL-10, TLR4, TLR6, TLR8, and CASP8."	0.1504424778761062	17

Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that play a crucial role in the innate immune response, particularly in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).

Key proteins involved in inflammasome activation include NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRP7, NLRP12, NLRC4, AIM2, and PYCARD. These proteins are part of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family and the PYHIN family, which are responsible for recognizing PAMPs and DAMPs and initiating the assembly of inflammasomes. The activation of inflammasomes leads to the activation of caspase-1 (CASP1), which in turn cleaves pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 into their active forms, promoting inflammation.

Several proteins in this system are involved in the regulation of inflammasome activation. For example, TNFAIP3 and CARD8 negatively regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome, while SERPINB1 inhibits caspase-1 activity. Additionally, TLR4, TLR6, and TLR8, which are part of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, can modulate inflammasome activation through the adaptor protein MYD88.

Circadian rhythms are endogenous, entrainable oscillations of about 24 hours that regulate various physiological processes, including sleep-wake cycles, hormone secretion, and metabolism.

Key proteins involved in circadian rhythm regulation include CLOCK, BMAL1, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1, and CRY2. The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer acts as a positive regulator, binding to E-box elements in the promoters of target genes, including PER and CRY genes. PER and CRY proteins form complexes that translocate to the nucleus and inhibit CLOCK-BMAL1 activity, creating a negative feedback loop.

Several kinases, such as CSNK1D and CSNK1E, phosphorylate PER proteins, leading to their degradation and allowing the cycle to restart. The balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is maintained by phosphatases like PPP1CB, PPP1CA, and PPP1CC.

SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, modulates the activity of CLOCK-BMAL1 by deacetylating BMAL1 and PER2. HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, histone deacetylases, also play roles in circadian regulation by modulating chromatin structure and gene expression.

Nuclear receptors, such as RORA, RORC, NR1D1, and PPARA, are involved in the regulation of BMAL1 and CLOCK expression, adding another layer of regulation to the circadian system. Additionally, proteins like ID1, ID2, ID3, and ID4 act as negative regulators of CLOCK-BMAL1 activity.
