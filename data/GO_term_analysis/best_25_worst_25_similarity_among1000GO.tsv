GO:0033693	NEFL NEFM NEFH	3	neurofilament bundle assembly	Neurofilament Assembly	"Proteins NEFL, NEFM, and NEFH are all neurofilament proteins, which are essential components of the neuronal cytoskeleton. The most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the assembly and maintenance of neurofilaments.

1. Neurofilament composition: NEFL, NEFM, and NEFH are the three main subunits of neurofilaments, with NEFL being the light chain, NEFM the medium chain, and NEFH the heavy chain. These subunits form the backbone of neurofilaments, providing structural support and stability to neurons.

2. Assembly mechanism: The assembly of neurofilaments is initiated by the formation of heterodimers between NEFL and either NEFM or NEFH. These heterodimers then associate laterally to form protofilaments, which subsequently align longitudinally to create the mature neurofilament structure.

3. Regulation of neurofilament assembly: The assembly and disassembly of neurofilaments are regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of NEFM and NEFH modulates their interaction with NEFL, affecting the stability and dynamics of neurofilaments.

4. Role in axonal transport: Neurofilaments are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of axons and facilitating axonal transport. The interaction between NEFL, NEFM, and NEFH ensures the proper organization of neurofilaments, which in turn supports the efficient transport of organelles and vesicles along axons.

This conclusion is based on the presence of key proteins involved in the synthesis, transport, and signaling of sphingolipids.

1. Sphingolipid synthesis: SMPD3 and SPHK1/2 are involved in the synthesis of sphingolipids. SMPD3 catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide, while SPHK1 and SPHK2 phosphorylate ceramide to generate sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P).

2. S1P receptors: S1PR1, S1PR2, S1PR3, S1PR4, and S1PR5 are G-protein coupled receptors that bind to S1P and mediate its signaling effects. The presence of multiple S1P receptors suggests a complex and diverse range of cellular responses to S1P signaling.

3. S1P transport: SPNS2 and MFSD2B are involved in the transport of S1P. SPNS2 exports S1P from cells, while MFSD2B imports S1P into cells, regulating its availability for signaling.

4. Downstream signaling: PIK3CB, PIK3CG, and AKT1 are involved in the downstream signaling of S1P. PIK3CB and PIK3CG are catalytic subunits of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), which phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol lipids and activate AKT1, a serine/threonine kinase. Activation of AKT1 leads to various cellular responses, including cell survival, proliferation, and migration.

5. Cytoskeletal regulation: RAC1 and EZR are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. RAC1 is a small GTPase that regulates actin polymerization, while EZR is an actin-binding protein that links the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. S1P signaling can modulate the actin cytoskeleton through RAC1 and EZR, affecting cell shape and motility.

6. Additional regulatory proteins: GPR6, KLF14, and PLPP3 are involved in the regulation of sphingolipid signaling. GPR6 is an orphan G-protein coupled receptor that may modulate S1P signaling. KLF14 is a transcription factor that can regulate the expression of genes involved in sphingolipid metabolism. PLPP3 is a lipid phosphatase that can dephosphorylate S1P, terminating its signaling.

In summary, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in sphingolipid signaling, with key proteins participating in the synthesis, transport, and signaling of sphingolipids, as well as the regulation of downstream cellular responses."	0.9506789	1	8.18732601932209e-05	sphingolipid mediated signaling pathway|regulation of sphingolipid mediated signaling pathway|inositol lipid-mediated signaling|cellular sphingolipid homeostasis|sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor signaling pathway|sphingolipid translocation|sphingolipid metabolic process|sphingolipid biosynthetic process|regulation of sphingolipid biosynthetic process|sphingoid biosynthetic process	0.9506789|0.8267909|0.7773764|0.7526927|0.75199246|0.7408902|0.7240604|0.71879244|0.71198356|0.68800145	1.7085643813176884e-57|2.6383374748699786e-06|0.0001724829674520516|1.0|3.541524011070576e-46|1.0|5.2941570863323686e-06|2.8231055409185444e-05|0.0002035596106274938|0.0002734802746334916	1.7085643813176884e-56|8.794458249566596e-06|0.000287471612420086|1.0|1.770762005535288e-45|1.0|1.323539271583092e-05|5.646211081837089e-05|0.0002907994437535626|0.0003418503432918645	1.0|0.1111111111111111|0.021164021164021163|0.0|0.8333333333333334|0.0|0.02857142857142857|0.03225806451612903|0.06896551724137931|0.06451612903225806	4

Critical Analysis:
The prominent biological process in this system of interacting proteins is oxytocin signaling and regulation. The interaction between OXT and OXTR is central to this process, as OXT is a neuropeptide hormone that binds to its receptor, OXTR, to initiate downstream signaling events. This interaction is crucial for various physiological and behavioral functions, such as social bonding, stress regulation, and lactation.

KCNB1, a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, plays a role in regulating membrane potential and neuronal excitability. Its interaction with STX1A suggests that it may influence the function of STX1A by modulating membrane potential, thereby affecting the release of neurotransmitters, including OXT.

STX1A, a SNARE protein, is involved in synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. Its direct interaction with OXT implies that it may have a regulatory role in the release of OXT, further contributing to the regulation of oxytocin signaling.

In summary, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is oxytocin signaling and regulation, with the key interaction being between OXT and OXTR. The other proteins, KCNB1 and STX1A, may contribute to the regulation of this process by modulating membrane potential and neurotransmitter release, respectively."	0.14325713	11964	0.9795316849516948	adenylate cyclase-inhibiting opioid receptor signaling pathway|osmosensory signaling pathway|response to organic cyclic compound|cellular response to organic cyclic compound|response to organonitrogen compound|response to ammonium ion|ornithine transport|response to oleic acid|response to organic substance|cellular response to organonitrogen compound	0.6903708|0.6443619|0.64420897|0.6266633|0.6195167|0.6179402|0.6129302|0.61129|0.61036295|0.6082256	1.0|1.0|0.039484394163712716|1.0|0.003249201636803454|1.0|1.0|1.0|0.04810227607007857|1.0	1.0|1.0|0.16034092023359522|1.0|0.03249201636803454|1.0|1.0|1.0|0.16034092023359522|1.0	0.0|0.0|0.002152852529601722|0.0|0.0029069767441860465|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0011355034065102195|0.0	5
