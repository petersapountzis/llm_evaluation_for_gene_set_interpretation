This process is initiated by the recognition of viral pathogens and activation of signaling pathways that lead to the production of antiviral proteins and cytokines.\n\n1. IL27RA and IL6ST: These proteins are subunits of the receptor complexes for the cytokines IL-27 and IL-6, respectively. IL-27 is known to induce antiviral responses, while IL-6 is involved in the regulation of immune responses. The presence of these receptor subunits suggests that the system is responsive to cytokine signaling.\n\n2. STAT1: This protein is a key transcription factor in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is activated by cytokines such as IL-27 and IL-6. Upon activation, STAT1 translocates to the nucleus and induces the expression of antiviral genes, including MX1, OAS1, and OAS2.\n\n3. MX1: This protein is an interferon-induced GTPase with antiviral activity against a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses. Its presence in the system indicates a direct antiviral function.\n\n4. OAS1, OAS2, and OASL: These proteins are members of the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family, which are induced by interferons and play a crucial role in the antiviral response. They synthesize 2'-5'-oligoadenylates that activate RNase L, leading to the degradation of viral RNA and inhibition of viral replication.\n\nIn summary, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the antiviral immune response, which is mediated by the activation of cytokine signaling pathways, induction of antiviral genes, and production of antiviral proteins.", "GO:0120180": "Process: Regulation of Actin Cytoskeleton Dynamics\n\nThe system of interacting proteins, including MAPRE2, STON1-GTF2A1L, PIK3R1, STON1, IQSEC1, ARF6, MAP4K4, and DUSP3, primarily contributes to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics.\n\n1. MAPRE2 (Microtubule-Associated Protein RP/EB Family Member 2) is involved in microtubule dynamics, which can indirectly affect actin cytoskeleton organization. MAPRE2 stabilizes microtubules and promotes their growth, influencing cell shape and motility.\n\n2. STON1-GTF2A1L (Stonin 1-GTF2A1L Readthrough) and STON1 (Stonin 1) are adaptor proteins that facilitate endocytosis. Endocytosis is a process that can impact actin cytoskeleton dynamics by regulating the internalization of membrane proteins and lipids.\n\n3. PIK3R1 (Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase Regulatory Subunit 1) is a regulatory subunit of PI3K, which is involved in the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 is a key signaling molecule that regulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics by activating downstream effectors, such as the Rho family of GTPases.\n\n4. IQSEC1 (IQ Motif and SEC7 Domain-Containing Protein 1) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARF6. It catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on ARF6, activating it.\n\n5. ARF6 (ADP-Ribosylation Factor 6) is a small GTPase that regulates endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Active ARF6 can promote actin polymerization and membrane ruffling, contributing to cell migration and invasion.\n\n6. MAP4K4 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase 4) is a serine/threonine kinase that can activate downstream MAPK signaling pathways. MAP4K4 has been implicated in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell migration, and invasion.\n\n7. DUSP3 (Dual Specificity Phosphatase 3) is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates MAP kinases, such as ERK1/2, JNK, and p38. By modulating MAPK signaling, DUSP3 can indirectly influence actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration.\n\nIn summary, the primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. The proteins contribute to this process through their involvement in microtubule stabilization, endocytosis, phosphoinositide signaling, ARF6 activation, MAPK signaling, and the modulation of actin polymerization and depolymerization.", "GO:0035608": "Process: Cytosolic Carboxypeptidase Activity\n\nThe primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is cytosolic carboxypeptidase activity, which involves the removal of C-terminal amino acids from proteins and peptides. This process is essential for protein turnover, maturation, and degradation.\n\n1. AGBL family proteins: AGBL1, AGBL2, AGBL3, AGBL4, and AGBL5 are members of the ATP/GTP-binding protein-like (AGBL) family. These proteins are cytosolic carboxypeptidases that remove C-terminal amino acids from proteins and peptides. They play a crucial role in protein turnover and maturation, as well as in the regulation of protein function.\n\n2. FOLH1 and FOLH1B: FOLH1 and FOLH1B are type II transmembrane glycoproteins that belong to the folate hydrolase family. They are involved in the hydrolysis of extracellular folate, which is essential for the synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids. This process is crucial for cell growth and division.\n\n3. AGTPBP1: AGTPBP1 is an ATP/GTP-binding protein that is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and neuronal development. It interacts with AGBL family proteins, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of cytosolic carboxypeptidase activity.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is cytosolic carboxypeptidase activity, which is essential for protein turnover, maturation, and degradation. The AGBL family proteins are the key players in this process, while FOLH1, FOLH1B, and AGTPBP1 contribute to the regulation and maintenance of cellular functions."}
