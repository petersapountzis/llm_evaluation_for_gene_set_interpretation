The most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the assembly and maintenance of neurofilaments.\n\n1. Neurofilament composition: NEFL, NEFM, and NEFH are the three main subunits of neurofilaments, with NEFL being the light chain, NEFM the medium chain, and NEFH the heavy chain. These subunits form the backbone of neurofilaments, providing structural support and stability to neurons.\n\n2.
