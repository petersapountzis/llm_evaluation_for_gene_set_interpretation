HSP90AA1 and ERP29 contribute to the proper folding and function of these proteins, while ANGPTL4 may have indirect effects on peroxisome function through its roles in angiogenesis and lipid metabolism.", "GO:0006971": "Process: Ion Transport Regulation\n\nThe primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of ion transport across cellular membranes. This is supported by the presence of several solute carrier (SLC) family proteins and ion channel proteins.\n\n1. SLC12A5 and SLC12A6 are members of the SLC12 family, which are cation-chloride cotransporters. They play a role in maintaining cellular ion homeostasis by transporting ions across the plasma membrane.\n\n2. SLC4A11 is a member of the SLC4 family, which are bicarbonate transporters. It is involved in the regulation of intracellular pH and the transport of ions across the plasma membrane.\n\n3. TRPV4 is a transient receptor potential cation channel that is involved in the regulation of cellular calcium levels. It is activated by various stimuli, including mechanical stress and changes in osmolarity.\n\n4. AQP5 is an aquaporin protein that facilitates the transport of water across cellular membranes. It plays a role in maintaining cellular water homeostasis.\n\n5. STK39 and OXSR1 are serine/threonine kinases that are involved in the regulation of ion transport. They phosphorylate and activate ion transporters and channels, such as SLC12 family proteins.\n\n6. CAB39 is a calcium-binding protein that interacts with STK39 and OXSR1, modulating their kinase activity and thus influencing ion transport regulation.\n\n7. ITGA2 is an integrin protein that is involved in cell adhesion and signaling. It may indirectly influence ion transport by modulating cellular responses to extracellular stimuli.\n\n8. MYLK is a myosin light chain kinase that is involved in the regulation of cellular contraction and motility. It may indirectly influence ion transport by modulating cellular responses to mechanical stress.\n\n9. TSPO is a translocator protein that is involved in the transport of cholesterol and other molecules across the mitochondrial membrane. It may indirectly influence ion transport by modulating cellular responses to changes in membrane lipid composition.\n\n10. FBP1 is a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase that is involved in gluconeogenesis. It may indirectly influence ion transport by modulating cellular responses to changes in energy metabolism.\n\nIn summary, this system of interacting proteins primarily functions in the regulation of ion transport across cellular membranes, with several proteins directly involved in ion transport and others indirectly influencing the process through modulation of cellular responses to various stimuli.", "GO:0036491": "Process: Integrated Stress Response Regulation\n\nProtein interactions in this system primarily revolve around the regulation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), a cellular response to various stress conditions. The key proteins involved in this process are EIF2AK4, EIF2AK3, PPP1R15A, and PPP1R15B.\n\n1. EIF2AK4 and EIF2AK3 are kinases that phosphorylate the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1). This phosphorylation event leads to a reduction in global protein synthesis, allowing the cell to conserve resources and mitigate stress. EIF2AK4 responds to amino acid deprivation, while EIF2AK3 is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.\n\n2. PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B are regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which dephosphorylates eIF2\u03b1. PPP1R15A is induced by stress and promotes the dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, thus reversing the translational inhibition and allowing the cell to recover. PPP1R15B, on the other hand, is constitutively expressed and maintains basal eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation levels.\n\n3. NCK1 and NCK2 are adaptor proteins that facilitate protein-protein interactions. They may play a role in modulating the activity of EIF2AK3 and EIF2AK4, as well as other signaling pathways involved in the ISR.\n\n4. DNAJC3 is a co-chaperone that interacts with EIF2AK3 and is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a subset of the ISR that specifically deals with ER stress. DNAJC3 may regulate the activity of EIF2AK3 and contribute to the overall regulation of the ISR.\n\n5. TMED2 is a member of the p24 family of proteins, which are involved in vesicular trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus. TMED2 may play a role in modulating the ISR by influencing the trafficking of proteins involved in the response, such as EIF2AK3.\n\nIn summary, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in the regulation of the Integrated Stress Response, with EIF2AK4, EIF2AK3, PPP1R15A, and PPP1R15B playing central roles in modulating eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in response to cellular stress. Other proteins, such as NCK1, NCK2, DNAJC3, and TMED2, may contribute to the regulation of the ISR through various mechanisms."}
