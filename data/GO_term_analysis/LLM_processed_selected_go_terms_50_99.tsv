GO:0032100	NPY OPRM1 GHSR GHRL	4	positive regulation of appetite	Appetite Regulation	"Proteins: NPY, OPRM1, GHSR, GHRL

1. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a potent appetite stimulant. It is produced in the hypothalamus and released in response to low energy levels. NPY acts on the Y1 and Y5 receptors, promoting food intake and decreasing energy expenditure. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis.

2. Opioid receptor mu 1 (OPRM1) is a G-protein coupled receptor that binds endogenous opioids, such as beta-endorphin. OPRM1 activation leads to increased dopamine release in the reward pathway, which is associated with the hedonic aspect of feeding. This receptor contributes to the regulation of food intake by modulating the rewarding properties of food.

3. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is a receptor for ghrelin, a hormone produced in the stomach. Ghrelin is the only known circulating hormone that increases appetite and promotes adiposity. GHSR is expressed in the hypothalamus, where it stimulates the release of NPY and AgRP, leading to increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure.

4. Ghrelin (GHRL) is a peptide hormone produced in the stomach and released into the bloodstream in response to fasting or caloric restriction. It acts on the GHSR in the hypothalamus, stimulating the release of NPY and AgRP, which in turn promote food intake and decrease energy expenditure. Ghrelin also has direct effects on the reward pathway, enhancing the hedonic aspect of feeding.

In conclusion, the interacting proteins NPY, OPRM1, GHSR, and GHRL are involved in the complex regulation of appetite and energy homeostasis. The most prominent biological process performed by this system is appetite regulation, which is achieved through the modulation of both homeostatic and hedonic aspects of feeding."

- TRUB1 may indirectly influence protein synthesis and cellular processes regulated by the TGF-β signaling pathway.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is TGF-β signaling and cellular differentiation. BMP4 and TGFB1 initiate the TGF-β signaling pathway, which is modulated by MYCN, a transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation and differentiation.

GO:0097324	KIT KITLG ZEB2	3	melanocyte migration	KIT-Mediated Signaling	"The primary biological process performed by the interacting proteins KIT, KITLG, and ZEB2 is KIT-mediated signaling, which plays a crucial role in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation.

1. KIT and KITLG interaction: KIT is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated upon binding to its ligand, KITLG (also known as stem cell factor or SCF). This interaction initiates a cascade of downstream signaling events, including the activation of PI3K/AKT, RAS/ERK, and JAK/STAT pathways. These pathways regulate various cellular processes, such as cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation, particularly in hematopoietic cells, melanocytes, and germ cells.

2. ZEB2 as a transcriptional regulator: ZEB2 is a transcription factor that plays a role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development and cellular differentiation. It is involved in processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and neural crest cell migration. ZEB2 can act as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, depending on the target genes and cellular context.

3. KIT and ZEB2 interaction: The interaction between KIT and ZEB2 is not well-established, but it is possible that KIT-mediated signaling could influence ZEB2 activity or expression. For example, KIT activation may lead to the phosphorylation of downstream targets that modulate ZEB2 function, or KIT signaling could regulate the transcription of ZEB2 target genes. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise nature of this interaction and its biological significance.

In summary, the most prominent biological process performed by the interacting proteins KIT, KITLG, and ZEB2 is KIT-mediated signaling, which regulates cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation.
