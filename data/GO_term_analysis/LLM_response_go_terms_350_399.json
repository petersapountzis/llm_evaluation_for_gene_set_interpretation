Dual roles in immune activation and inhibition\n- Some proteins, like CEACAM1 and CD160, can have both activating and inhibitory effects on immune cells, depending on the context and interacting partners. This highlights the complexity and fine-tuning of immune cell regulation in this system.\n\nIn conclusion, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in immune cell activation and regulation, with a focus on cytokine production, cell adhesion, immune synapse formation, and immune checkpoint modulation. The proteins play crucial roles in promoting and fine-tuning immune responses, ensuring effective defense against pathogens while maintaining immune homeostasis.", "GO:0097499": "Process: Ciliogenesis and Ciliary Function\n\n1.
