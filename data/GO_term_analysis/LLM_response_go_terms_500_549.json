They contribute to phosphate homeostasis by regulating phosphate release from cells.\n\n4. PTH and FGF23: These hormones regulate phosphate homeostasis by modulating renal phosphate reabsorption and intestinal phosphate absorption. PTH decreases renal phosphate reabsorption, while FGF23 inhibits both renal phosphate reabsorption and intestinal phosphate absorption.\n\n5. ANKH and ENPP1: These proteins are involved in the regulation of extracellular ATP and pyrophosphate levels. ANKH mediates the transport of ATP and pyrophosphate, while ENPP1 hydrolyzes ATP to generate pyrophosphate. Both proteins contribute to the regulation of mineralization processes.\n\n6. ABCC6 and XPR1: These proteins are involved in the transport of inorganic phosphate. ABCC6 is an ATP-dependent transporter that mediates the efflux of inorganic phosphate, while XPR1 is a phosphate exporter. Both proteins contribute to the regulation of phosphate homeostasis.\n\n7. FGFR4 and GCM2: These proteins are involved in the regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. FGFR4 is a receptor for FGF23, which inhibits PTH secretion, while GCM2 is a transcription factor that regulates PTH gene expression. Both proteins contribute to the regulation of phosphate homeostasis through their effects on PTH secretion.\n\n8. SFRP4, SLC9A3R1, and TFAP2B: These proteins are involved in the regulation of renal phosphate reabsorption. SFRP4 inhibits Wnt signaling, which promotes phosphate reabsorption, while SLC9A3R1 and TFAP2B are involved in the regulation of sodium-phosphate co-transporters. All three proteins contribute to the maintenance of phosphate homeostasis by modulating renal phosphate reabsorption.", "GO:0060088": "Process: Hair Cell Stereocilia Development and Maintenance\n\nThe primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the development and maintenance of hair cell stereocilia, which are essential for auditory and vestibular functions. The proteins involved in this process include SCRIB, STRC, PLS1, PDZD7, TRIOBP, TPRN, CLRN1, WHRN, GRXCR2, CLRN2, LHFPL5, CDH23, MYO7A, and SLC9A3R1.\n\n1. Stereocilia bundle formation and cohesion: CDH23 and PLS1 are crucial for the formation and cohesion of stereocilia bundles. CDH23 is a cadherin protein that forms tip links between adjacent stereocilia, allowing for mechanotransduction. PLS1 is an actin-bundling protein that maintains stereocilia structure and rigidity.\n\n2. Stereocilia elongation and actin regulation: MYO7A, TRIOBP, and TPRN are involved in stereocilia elongation and actin regulation. MYO7A is a motor protein that transports cargo along actin filaments, while TRIOBP and TPRN are actin-binding proteins that stabilize and organize the actin cytoskeleton.\n\n3. Mechanotransduction and ion homeostasis: CLRN1, CLRN2, LHFPL5, and SLC9A3R1 are essential for mechanotransduction and ion homeostasis in hair cells. CLRN1 and CLRN2 are transmembrane proteins that interact with other proteins to form the mechanotransduction complex. LHFPL5 is involved in the assembly of the mechanotransduction machinery, while SLC9A3R1 is an ion transporter that maintains intracellular ion concentrations.\n\n4. Protein trafficking and localization: SCRIB, SEC24B, and PDZD7 are involved in protein trafficking and localization. SCRIB is a scaffold protein that regulates the localization of other proteins, while SEC24B is a component of the COPII complex, which is involved in protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. PDZD7 is a scaffold protein that interacts with other proteins to form complexes at the base of stereocilia.\n\n5. Protein-protein interactions and scaffolding: WHRN and GRXCR2 are involved in protein-protein interactions and scaffolding. WHRN is a scaffold protein that interacts with other proteins to form complexes at the tips of stereocilia, while GRXCR2 is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics and stereocilia morphology.\n\n6. Protection against oxidative stress: SOD1 is an antioxidant enzyme that protects hair cells from oxidative stress by catalyzing the dismutation of superoxide radicals into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide.\n\nIn conclusion, this system of interacting proteins plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of hair cell stereocilia, which are essential for auditory and vestibular functions. The proteins are involved in various aspects of stereocilia formation, actin regulation, mechanotransduction, protein trafficking, and protection against oxidative stress."}
