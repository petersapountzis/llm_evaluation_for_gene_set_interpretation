G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs): This system includes several GPCRs, such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), DRD3 (dopamine receptor D3), DRD4 (dopamine receptor D4), and GHSR (growth hormone secretagogue receptor). GPCRs are involved in various signaling pathways and play important roles in cellular communication and response to external stimuli.\n\n5. Transcription factors and gene regulation: Proteins such as SREBF1 (sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1), FOXO1 (forkhead box O1), and NR1H3 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 3) are transcription factors that regulate gene expression and are involved in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis.\n\nIn conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is insulin signaling and metabolic regulation, with additional involvement in inflammation, immune response, GPCR signaling, and gene regulation."}
