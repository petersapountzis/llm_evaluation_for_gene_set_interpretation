Interaction with other signaling pathways: Several proteins in the system, such as GSK3B, MTOR, MAPK7, and ERBB3, are involved in other signaling pathways that can be modulated by calcium signaling. For example, GSK3B is a kinase that regulates various cellular processes, including glycogen metabolism and cell proliferation, and its activity can be inhibited by calcineurin.\n\n6. Role in muscle function: Proteins such as ACTN3, FHL2, MYOZ1, and MYOZ2 are involved in muscle function and are regulated by calcium signaling. ACTN3, for instance, is an actin-binding protein that plays a role in muscle contraction.\n\n7. Involvement in immune response: Proteins like TNF, CLEC7A, and PLCG2 are involved in immune response and can be regulated by calcium signaling. TNF is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, while CLEC7A is a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes fungal cell wall components.\n\n8. Regulation of ion transport: Proteins such as SLC9A1 and ATP2B4 are involved in ion transport and can be modulated by calcium signaling. SLC9A1 is a sodium-hydrogen exchanger, while ATP2B4 is a plasma membrane calcium-transporting ATPase.\n\nIn conclusion, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in calcium signaling and regulation, which is crucial for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, and gene expression."}
