GO:0070106	IL27RA MX1 OASL OAS1 STAT1 OAS2 IL6ST	7	interleukin-27-mediated signaling pathway	Antiviral Immune Response	"The primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the antiviral immune response. This process is initiated by the recognition of viral pathogens and activation of signaling pathways that lead to the production of antiviral proteins and cytokines.

1. IL27RA and IL6ST: These proteins are subunits of the receptor complexes for the cytokines IL-27 and IL-6, respectively. IL-27 is known to induce antiviral responses, while IL-6 is involved in the regulation of immune responses. The presence of these receptor subunits suggests that the system is responsive to cytokine signaling.

2. STAT1: This protein is a key transcription factor in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is activated by cytokines such as IL-27 and IL-6. Upon activation, STAT1 translocates to the nucleus and induces the expression of antiviral genes, including MX1, OAS1, and OAS2.

3. MX1: This protein is an interferon-induced GTPase with antiviral activity against a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses. Its presence in the system indicates a direct antiviral function.

4. OAS1, OAS2, and OASL: These proteins are members of the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family, which are induced by interferons and play a crucial role in the antiviral response. They synthesize 2'-5'-oligoadenylates that activate RNase L, leading to the degradation of viral RNA and inhibition of viral replication.

In summary, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the antiviral immune response, which is mediated by the activation of cytokine signaling pathways, induction of antiviral genes, and production of antiviral proteins."
