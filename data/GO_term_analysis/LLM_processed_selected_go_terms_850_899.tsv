Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades and recycles damaged organelles and proteins, while nutrient sensing is the ability of cells to detect and respond to changes in nutrient availability.

1. Autophagy regulation: Several proteins in this system are involved in the initiation, elongation, and maturation of autophagosomes, which are the vesicles responsible for engulfing cellular components targeted for degradation. Key proteins include BECN1, ATG5, ATG7, and ATG14, which are essential for autophagosome formation.
