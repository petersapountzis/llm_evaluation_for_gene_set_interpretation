The proteins in this system can be classified into several categories, including nuclear receptors, coactivators, corepressors, and other interacting proteins.

Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a family of transcription factors that regulate gene expression in response to ligand binding. Key NRs in this system include NR2C1, NR2F1, NR2E3, NR4A3, NR1D1, NR1H4, NR1H3, NR3C1, NR1D2, NR3C2, NR2E1, NR2C2, NR4A1, NR4A2, NR5A2, NR6A1, and NR1H2. These receptors are involved in various biological processes, such as metabolism, development, and immune response.

Coactivators and corepressors are proteins that modulate the activity of nuclear receptors. Coactivators, such as NCOA1, NCOA2, NCOA4, and MED1, enhance the transcriptional activity of NRs, while corepressors, such as NCOR1, NCOR2, and GPS2, inhibit their activity. The balance between coactivators and corepressors determines the transcriptional output of NRs.

These enzymes modulate the activity of NRs and their interacting proteins by adding or removing chemical groups, such as acetyl, methyl, or phosphate groups.

Several proteins in this system are involved in protein-protein interactions and protein stability, such as USP17L2, RNF34, NEDD4, UFL1, RNF6, SKP2, TRIM15, TRIM24, TRIM25, TRIM68, ITCH, UBE3A, and UBR5. These proteins regulate the stability and function of NRs and their interacting proteins through ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes.

Additionally, proteins involved in signal transduction and immune response, such as RIPK2, MYD88, TLR4, TLR8, TLR3, IRAK4, TRAF6, IRF7, and IRF3, are present in this system. These proteins modulate the activity of NRs in response to various stimuli, such as cytokines, pathogens, and environmental factors.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is nuclear receptor signaling. This process is crucial for regulating gene expression in response to various stimuli and is modulated by a complex network of proteins, including nuclear receptors, coactivators, corepressors, enzymes involved in post-translational modifications, and proteins involved in protein-protein interactions and protein stability."

Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, while cell migration is the movement of cells from one location to another.

1. Key proteins in angiogenesis: VEGFA, VEGFC, KDR, ANGPT1, ANGPT2, ANGPT4, and TEK are all involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. VEGFA and VEGFC are potent angiogenic factors that bind to their respective receptors, KDR and FLT4, to promote endothelial cell proliferation and migration. ANGPT1, ANGPT2, and ANGPT4 are angiopoietins that regulate blood vessel maturation and stability by interacting with the TEK receptor.

2. Key proteins in cell migration: RHOA, ROCK1, ROCK2, PTK2, and PTK2B are involved in the regulation of cell migration. RHOA is a small GTPase that controls actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration. ROCK1 and ROCK2 are RHOA effectors that regulate actomyosin contractility and cell motility. PTK2 and PTK2B are focal adhesion kinases that mediate integrin signaling and cell migration.

Cross-talk between angiogenesis and cell migration: Several proteins, such as PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, PIK3CG, and PIK3R3, are involved in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, which regulates both angiogenesis and cell migration. Activation of PI3K signaling promotes endothelial cell survival, proliferation, and migration during angiogenesis, as well as the migration of various cell types.

4. Regulation of angiogenesis and cell migration: Various transcription factors, such as ETS1, FOXC2, GATA2, GATA3, SNAI1, SNAI2, SOX9, and ZEB2, are involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and cell migration. These transcription factors control the expression of genes that are critical for endothelial cell differentiation, blood vessel formation, and cell motility.

5. Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling: Proteins such as MMP9, ADAM9, ADAM17, and LOXL2 are involved in ECM remodeling, which is essential for angiogenesis and cell migration. ECM remodeling allows cells to degrade and reorganize the surrounding matrix, facilitating their movement and the formation of new blood vessels.

6. Inhibition of angiogenesis and cell migration: Proteins such as THBS1, SPARC, and SERPINF1 are involved in the inhibition of angiogenesis and cell migration. These proteins can negatively regulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and blood vessel formation, maintaining a balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors.

In conclusion, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in the biological processes of angiogenesis and cell migration. The proteins regulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and blood vessel formation, as well as the movement of various cell types. The system also includes proteins that modulate ECM remodeling and inhibit angiogenesis and cell migration, maintaining a balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors."

SULF1 and SULF2 are sulfatases that modify heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which can affect FGF signaling by altering the availability of FGF ligands.

Other proteins in the system are involved in processes related to FGF signaling. For example, WNT4 and WNT5A are members of the Wnt signaling pathway, which can interact with FGF signaling to regulate cell fate determination and tissue patterning. CD44 is a cell surface receptor involved in cell adhesion and migration, processes that can be influenced by FGF signaling. Additionally, extracellular matrix components such as COL1A1 and THBS1 can affect FGF signaling by modulating the availability and activity of FGF ligands.

In summary, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the FGF signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes.

Key proteins in this process include APOC3, APOE, APOA4, APOA5, APOA1, APOA2, APOB, APOC1, APOC2, CETP, LCAT, MTTP, PLTP, and PCSK9. These proteins are involved in the synthesis, transport, and clearance of lipoproteins, which are essential for maintaining lipid homeostasis.

APOC3, APOA4, APOA5, APOA1, APOA2, APOB, APOC1, and APOC2 are apolipoproteins that play crucial roles in the assembly, stabilization, and metabolism of lipoproteins. They interact with lipids and other proteins to form lipoprotein particles, which transport lipids through the bloodstream. APOE is particularly important for the clearance of chylomicron remnants and VLDL particles, while APOA1 and APOA2 are major components of HDL particles, which are involved in reverse cholesterol transport.

CETP, LCAT, and PLTP are involved in the remodeling of lipoprotein particles. CETP mediates the exchange of lipids between lipoproteins, LCAT esterifies free cholesterol in HDL particles, and PLTP transfers phospholipids between lipoproteins. These proteins contribute to the maturation and transformation of lipoprotein particles, which is essential for lipid transport and metabolism.

MTTP is involved in the assembly and secretion of lipoprotein particles, particularly chylomicrons and VLDL. It is essential for the transport of dietary and endogenous lipids from the intestine and liver to peripheral tissues.

PCSK9 is a key regulator of LDL receptor (LDLR) levels, which are responsible for the clearance of LDL particles from the bloodstream. PCSK9 promotes the degradation of LDLR, thus modulating the uptake of LDL particles and cholesterol levels in the blood.

Several other proteins in the system, such as ABCA1, ABCG1, ABCG5, and ABCG8, are involved in lipid transport across cell membranes. These proteins facilitate the efflux of cholesterol and other lipids from cells to lipoprotein particles or bile, contributing to lipid homeostasis.

In addition to lipid metabolism and transport, this system of interacting proteins also includes proteins involved in signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation, such as PPARG, RXRA, NR1H3, and NR1H2. These proteins modulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, transport, and storage, further contributing to the regulation of lipid homeostasis.

Overall, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of lipid metabolism and transport, which is essential for maintaining lipid homeostasis and preventing lipid-related disorders."
