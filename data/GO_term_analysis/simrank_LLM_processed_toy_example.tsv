1. TEK (Tie2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones. It is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells and is activated by its ligands, ANGPT1 and ANGPT2.

2. ANGPT1 (Angiopoietin-1) is a secreted glycoprotein that binds to and activates TEK, promoting endothelial cell survival, migration, and blood vessel maturation. It is essential for vascular development and stabilization.

3. SVEP1 (Sushi, von Willebrand factor type A, EGF, and pentraxin domain-containing protein 1) is an extracellular matrix protein that interacts with TEK and modulates its activity. SVEP1 has been shown to enhance ANGPT1-induced TEK phosphorylation, thus promoting angiogenesis.

4. ANGPT2 (Angiopoietin-2) is another ligand for TEK, but it acts as a context-dependent antagonist or agonist. In the presence of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), ANGPT2 promotes angiogenesis by destabilizing blood vessels, allowing endothelial cells to proliferate and migrate. In the absence of VEGF, ANGPT2 inhibits angiogenesis by competing with ANGPT1 for TEK binding, leading to vessel regression.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of angiogenesis. TEK, ANGPT1, SVEP1, and ANGPT2 work together to control blood vessel formation, maturation, and stabilization. The balance between ANGPT1 and ANGPT2 binding to TEK is critical for maintaining proper vascular development and function."	0.5065609	218	0.9821516292778778	hypomethylation of CpG island	0.2619431	8667	0.2904044539053545	regulation of angiogenesis|regulation of sprouting angiogenesis|angiogenesis|regulation of vasculogenesis|regulation of blood vessel remodeling|regulation of vasculature development|regulation of vascular wound healing|blood vessel remodeling|positive regulation of angiogenesis|regulation of blood vessel endothelial cell proliferation involved in sprouting angiogenesis|angiogenesis involved in wound healing|regulation of endothelial tube morphogenesis|regulation of vascular permeability|regulation of collateral sprouting|negative regulation of angiogenesis|regulation of blood vessel branching|regulation of vascular endothelial cell proliferation|positive regulation of blood vessel remodeling|regulation of endothelial cell proliferation|blood vessel maturation|sprouting angiogenesis|regulation of cell migration involved in sprouting angiogenesis|regulation of endothelial cell development|regulation of blood circulation|vasculature development|vasculogenesis|angiogenesis involved in coronary vascular morphogenesis|blood vessel morphogenesis|positive regulation of sprouting angiogenesis|regulation of endothelial cell differentiation|regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway|blood vessel development|regulation of cellular response to vascular endothelial growth factor stimulus|regulation of tissue remodeling|vasodilation|regulation of vasoconstriction|regulation of lymphangiogenesis|regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor production|vascular process in circulatory system|response to ischemia|vascular wound healing|regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling pathway|blood vessel endothelial cell proliferation involved in sprouting angiogenesis|cellular response to vascular endothelial growth factor stimulus|maintenance of blood vessel diameter homeostasis by renin-angiotensin|positive regulation of vasculogenesis|endothelial cell morphogenesis|blood vessel diameter maintenance|vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway|regulation of endothelial cell apoptotic process	0.96088314|0.8653412|0.8207574|0.81031954|0.77617645|0.7640965|0.7502924|0.7491588|0.7473809|0.7420914|0.7084826|0.704408|0.7036404|0.70229065|0.6942389|0.694046|0.6861436|0.6823939|0.68052727|0.6780722|0.6731369|0.67313147|0.6729592|0.6713199|0.667112|0.661926|0.66128933|0.6499671|0.648685|0.6456952|0.643984|0.6436535|0.64355624|0.64184535|0.6409081|0.63951993|0.6322609|0.630236|0.6253995|0.6234622|0.6228564|0.61820394|0.61690426|0.6166327|0.61430085|0.6125932|0.60932004|0.6088718|0.6074005|0.6072153
