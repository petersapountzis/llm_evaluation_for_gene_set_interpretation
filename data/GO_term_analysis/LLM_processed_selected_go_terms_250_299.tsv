This is supported by the presence of several solute carrier (SLC) family proteins and ion channel proteins.

1. SLC12A5 and SLC12A6 are members of the SLC12 family, which are cation-chloride cotransporters. They play a role in maintaining cellular ion homeostasis by transporting ions across the plasma membrane.

2. SLC4A11 is a member of the SLC4 family, which are bicarbonate transporters. It is involved in the regulation of intracellular pH and the transport of ions across the plasma membrane.

3. TRPV4 is a transient receptor potential cation channel that is involved in the regulation of cellular calcium levels. It is activated by various stimuli, including mechanical stress and changes in osmolarity.

GO:0036491	EIF2AK4 NCK2 PPP1R15B PPP1R15A EIF2AK3 DNAJC3 TMED2 NCK1	8	regulation of translation initiation in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress	Integrated Stress Response Regulation	"Protein interactions in this system primarily revolve around the regulation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), a cellular response to various stress conditions. The key proteins involved in this process are EIF2AK4, EIF2AK3, PPP1R15A, and PPP1R15B.

1. EIF2AK4 and EIF2AK3 are kinases that phosphorylate the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). This phosphorylation event leads to a reduction in global protein synthesis, allowing the cell to conserve resources and mitigate stress. EIF2AK4 responds to amino acid deprivation, while EIF2AK3 is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

2. PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B are regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which dephosphorylates eIF2α. PPP1R15A is induced by stress and promotes the dephosphorylation of eIF2α, thus reversing the translational inhibition and allowing the cell to recover. PPP1R15B, on the other hand, is constitutively expressed and maintains basal eIF2α phosphorylation levels.

3. NCK1 and NCK2 are adaptor proteins that facilitate protein-protein interactions. They may play a role in modulating the activity of EIF2AK3 and EIF2AK4, as well as other signaling pathways involved in the ISR.

4. DNAJC3 is a co-chaperone that interacts with EIF2AK3 and is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a subset of the ISR that specifically deals with ER stress. DNAJC3 may regulate the activity of EIF2AK3 and contribute to the overall regulation of the ISR.

5. TMED2 is a member of the p24 family of proteins, which are involved in vesicular trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus. TMED2 may play a role in modulating the ISR by influencing the trafficking of proteins involved in the response, such as EIF2AK3.

In summary, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in the regulation of the Integrated Stress Response, with EIF2AK4, EIF2AK3, PPP1R15A, and PPP1R15B playing central roles in modulating eIF2α phosphorylation in response to cellular stress. Other proteins, such as NCK1, NCK2, DNAJC3, and TMED2, may contribute to the regulation of the ISR through various mechanisms."
