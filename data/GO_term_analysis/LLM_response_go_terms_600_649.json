Integrin and cadherin involvement: ITGA2 is an integrin protein that mediates cell adhesion and migration, which are essential processes during angiogenesis. CDH13, a member of the cadherin family, also contributes to cell adhesion and is involved in vascular development.\n\n4. Neurotrophic factors: NTF3 and ARTN are neurotrophic factors that can influence angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell survival and growth. NTRK3 is a receptor for neurotrophic factors, and its activation can lead to pro-angiogenic signaling.\n\n5. Chemokines and cytokines: CXCL8, CXCL12, CCR4, and IL16 are chemokines and cytokines that can modulate angiogenesis by recruiting immune cells and influencing endothelial cell behavior.\n\n6. Coagulation factors: F2RL1, F3, and F7 are coagulation factors that can impact angiogenesis by regulating blood clotting and fibrinolysis, which are essential for maintaining vascular integrity.\n\n7. Other factors: SCG2, AGER, S1PR1, CASR, FGF10, and SMAD3 are additional proteins that can influence angiogenesis through various mechanisms, such as modulating cell signaling, promoting cell migration, or regulating gene expression.\n\nIn conclusion, this system of interacting proteins is primarily involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. The proteins work together to modulate endothelial cell behavior, blood vessel formation, and vascular integrity, which are essential for various physiological processes."}
