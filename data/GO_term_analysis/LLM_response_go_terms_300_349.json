Deficiency of IDUA leads to mucopolysaccharidosis type I (Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie syndromes), which are characterized by the accumulation of GAGs in cells.\n\n4. HYAL4: Hyaluronidase-4 is an enzyme that degrades hyaluronic acid, a GAG found in the extracellular matrix. HYAL4 is involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix and has been implicated in processes such as tissue repair and tumor progression.\n\n5. HYAL1: Hyaluronidase-1 is another enzyme that degrades hyaluronic acid. It plays a role in the turnover and homeostasis of hyaluronic acid in the extracellular matrix. Mutations in the HYAL1 gene have been associated with mucopolysaccharidosis type IX, a rare lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of GAGs in cells.\n\nIn summary, the interacting proteins HEXB, GUSB, IDUA, HYAL4, and HYAL1 are involved in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans, which is essential for maintaining the homeostasis and integrity of the extracellular matrix. Dysregulation or deficiency of these enzymes can lead to lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the accumulation of GAGs in cells.", "GO:0002265": "Process: Amyloid-beta Production and Clearance\n\nProtein Interactions:\n1. LRP1 (Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) interacts with PSEN1 (Presenilin 1) and APP (Amyloid precursor protein).\n2. PSEN1 is a component of the gamma-secretase complex, which cleaves APP.\n3. APP is cleaved by gamma-secretase to produce amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides.\n4. GRN (Progranulin) is involved in lysosomal function and may influence A\u03b2 clearance.\n\nAnalysis:\n1. LRP1-PSEN1 interaction: LRP1 is a cell surface receptor involved in endocytosis and trafficking of various ligands, including APP. PSEN1 is a catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase complex. The interaction between LRP1 and PSEN1 may regulate gamma-secretase activity and APP processing, affecting A\u03b2 production.\n\n2. LRP1-APP interaction: LRP1 mediates the endocytosis and clearance of APP from the cell surface. This interaction may influence the availability of APP for processing by secretases, thereby modulating A\u03b2 production.\n\n3. PSEN1-APP interaction: PSEN1, as part of the gamma-secretase complex, cleaves APP to produce A\u03b2 peptides. Mutations in PSEN1 are associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, leading to increased A\u03b2 production and aggregation.\n\n4. GRN involvement in A\u03b2 clearance: GRN is a secreted glycoprotein involved in lysosomal function and inflammation. It has been suggested that GRN may influence A\u03b2 clearance through its role in lysosomal degradation pathways. Mutations in GRN are associated with frontotemporal dementia, indicating a potential link between GRN function and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is amyloid-beta production and clearance. The interactions between LRP1, PSEN1, and APP regulate the processing of APP and the generation of A\u03b2 peptides, while GRN may influence the clearance of A\u03b2 through its role in lysosomal function. Dysregulation of these interactions and processes may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.", "GO:0000738": "Process: RNA Degradation and Regulation\n\nProtein Interactions:\n1.
