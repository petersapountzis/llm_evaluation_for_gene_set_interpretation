To summarize, the proteins in this set are involved in various aspects of the immune response, including chemotaxis, immune cell migration, and positioning, as well as the modulation of inflammation. Additionally, some proteins are involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, which is often associated with immune responses and tissue repair. The interplay between these proteins suggests a system that is primarily engaged in modulating the immune response and facilitating the structural changes required for effective immune function and tissue repair."	0.85	Medium Confidence
