Rho GTPases, such as RAS, RAP1, and RHOG, are key regulators of various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and cell adhesion. The presence of multiple Rho GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) in the system highlights the importance of Rho GTPase regulation.

Key proteins involved in Rho GTPase regulation include ARHGAPs (e.g., ARHGAP11A, ARHGAP22, ARHGAP24, ARHGAP27, ARHGAP29, ARHGAP35, ARHGAP42, ARHGAP45, and ARHGAP6), RALGAPs (e.g., RALGAPA1, RALGAPA2, RALGAPB), and RASGRFs (e.g., RASGRF1, RASGRF2). These proteins function as GAPs, promoting the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, thereby inactivating Rho GTPases. Conversely, Rho GEFs, such as ARHGEFs (e.g., ARHGEF5, ARHGEF7, ARHGEF15, ARHGEF16, ARHGEF19, ARHGEF26), VAV1, and TIAM1/2, facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP, activating Rho GTPases.

Additionally, the system includes several regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins (e.g., RGS1, RGS4, RGS6, RGS8, RGS10, RGS11, RGS14, RGS16), which modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. GPCRs can activate Rho GTPases through G proteins, further emphasizing the importance of Rho GTPase regulation in this system.

The presence of chemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CCL11, CCL13, CCL14, CCL15, CCL16, CCL17, CCL18, CCL19, CCL20, CCL21, CCL22, CCL23, CCL24, CCL25, CCL26, CX3CL1, CXCL13) and their receptors (e.g., CCR7, S1PR1) suggests a role for this system in chemotaxis and immune cell regulation. Chemokines can activate Rho GTPases through GPCRs, linking chemotaxis to Rho GTPase signaling.

The system also contains proteins involved in cell adhesion (e.g., ITGA6, ITGB1, LIMS1, FERMT2, F11R) and cytoskeletal organization (e.g., CRK, CRKL, CORO1C, MAPRE2, AFDN, BIN1, NDEL1), which are processes regulated by Rho GTPases. Furthermore, proteins such as TSC1/2, GSK3B, AKT2, and PTK2B are involved in the regulation of cell growth and survival, which can be influenced by Rho GTPase signaling.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the regulation of Rho GTPase signaling, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, cell adhesion, and chemotaxis."
