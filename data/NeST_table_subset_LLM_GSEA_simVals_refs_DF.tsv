These processes are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations.

1. ERCC1 and ERCC4: These proteins form a heterodimeric endonuclease complex involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). ERCC1 is responsible for DNA damage recognition, while ERCC4 provides the catalytic activity for DNA incision. Together, they remove DNA lesions caused by UV radiation and other genotoxic agents, preventing mutations and maintaining genomic stability.

2. MLH1, MLH3, PMS1, and PMS2: These proteins are part of the MutL family and play essential roles in DNA mismatch repair (MMR). MLH1 forms heterodimers with PMS2 (MutLα), MLH3 (MutLγ), and PMS1 (MutLβ). MutLα is the primary complex involved in MMR, while MutLγ and MutLβ have specialized roles in meiotic recombination and mutation avoidance, respectively. These complexes coordinate with MutS family proteins (MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6) to recognize and repair DNA mismatches, insertions, and deletions, ensuring accurate DNA replication and preventing mutations.

3. MSH2, MSH3, MSH6: These proteins belong to the MutS family and are involved in DNA mismatch repair (MMR). MSH2 forms heterodimers with MSH6 (MutSα) and MSH3 (MutSβ). MutSα recognizes base mismatches and small insertion/deletion loops, while MutSβ recognizes larger insertion/deletion loops. These complexes initiate the MMR process by binding to DNA mismatches and recruiting MutL family proteins to repair the errors.

4. SLX4: This protein acts as a scaffold for multiple structure-specific endonucleases, including ERCC1-ERCC4, and is involved in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks, double-strand breaks, and replication fork collapse. SLX4 interacts with ERCC1 and ERCC4, coordinating their activities in nucleotide excision repair and ensuring the efficient removal of DNA lesions.

In conclusion, the primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is DNA mismatch repair and excision repair, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations. The proteins work together in a coordinated manner to recognize and repair DNA errors, ensuring accurate DNA replication and preventing the accumulation of mutations that could lead to diseases such as cancer."	0	7/25	2.2663315591582227e-19	1.5660316092380094e-17	ERCC1,ERCC4,MLH1,MLH3,MSH2,MSH3,MSH6,PMS1,PMS2,SLX4	MSH6;MSH2;MSH3;PMS2;MLH1;MLH3;PMS1	Mismatch Repair 	GO:0006298	0.789281	0.7637749	Tied	"The primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is DNA mismatch repair and excision repair.

These proteins play crucial roles in maintaining genomic stability and preventing the accumulation of mutations that can lead to diseases such as cancer.

1. ATM and ATR: These proteins are key kinases involved in the DNA damage response. They are activated by different types of DNA damage, such as double-strand breaks (ATM) and replication stress (ATR). Upon activation, they phosphorylate numerous downstream targets, including other proteins in this system, to initiate the appropriate repair pathways.

2. BLM: This protein is a RecQ helicase that plays a role in DNA repair, replication, and recombination. BLM is involved in resolving complex DNA structures, such as Holliday junctions, and preventing genome instability. Mutations in BLM can lead to Bloom syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by increased cancer susceptibility.

3. BRCA1: This protein is a tumor suppressor involved in multiple DNA repair pathways, including homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. BRCA1 interacts with several other proteins in this system, such as ATM and ATR, to coordinate the DNA damage response. Mutations in BRCA1 are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

4. XPA and XPC: These proteins are involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), a pathway that removes bulky DNA lesions, such as those caused by UV radiation. XPC is responsible for damage recognition, while XPA plays a role in damage verification and recruitment of other NER factors. Defects in XPA or XPC can lead to xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to sunlight and increased skin cancer risk.
