BRAF acts downstream of RAS proteins and is a key player in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, affecting gene expression.

2. SMO, or Smoothened, is a G protein-coupled receptor that is a central component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for embryonic development and, in adults, plays a role in tissue regeneration and stem cell maintenance. Aberrant activation of the Hh pathway can also lead to tumorigenesis. SMO is regulated by the Hh ligand, and upon activation, it initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of GLI transcription factors.

3. DNA Replication and Repair: Proteins such as MCM2-7, PCNA, RPA1-3, and DNA polymerases (POLA2, POLD1-3, POLE) are involved in DNA replication. The MCM complex acts as the replicative helicase, PCNA is the sliding clamp for DNA polymerases, and RPA proteins stabilize single-stranded DNA. RAD50, MRE11, NBN, BRCA1, and BRCA2 are involved in DNA repair, particularly homologous recombination, which is crucial for repairing double-strand breaks.

4. Chromatin Organization and Modification: Proteins like HMGA1, HMGB2, HMGB3, and histone modifiers such as EZH2 (part of the PRC2 complex) and SUV39H1 are involved in chromatin organization and epigenetic regulation. These modifications can influence gene expression and are also important during replication and repair to restore chromatin structure.

5. Checkpoint Control and Apoptosis: CHEK1, CHEK2, TP53, and BIRC5 (Survivin) are key components of the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoints. TP53 is a well-known tumor suppressor that can induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. CHEK1 and CHEK2 are kinases that mediate cell cycle checkpoints and facilitate DNA repair.

6. Cytoskeletal Dynamics: Proteins such as TUBB, TUBG1, and various kinesins (e.g., KIF2C, KIF4A) are involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, which is crucial for cell division, particularly during mitosis when the mitotic spindle must form and function correctly to ensure proper chromosome segregation.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system work in concert to ensure the accurate replication of the genome and its equal distribution to daughter cells during cell division. They are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, DNA replication and repair, chromatin modification, checkpoint control, and cytoskeletal dynamics. The interplay between these proteins maintains genomic stability and prevents the propagation of damaged DNA, which is essential for the prevention of oncogenesis and the preservation of cellular integrity."	0.98	0	51/288	2.630437768350129e-49	2.85665541642824e-46	TOP2A;DCLRE1B;MRE11;MCM7;HMGB2;HMGB3;BRCA1;CHEK1;NBN;KPNA2;POLE;RFC3;LIG1;RFC2;HUS1;SMC1A;RAD51C;MSH2;TIMELESS;MCM3;MCM4;MCM5;MCM6;DCTPP1;ASF1A;MCM2;PRIM2;RNASEH2A;PRKDC;PDS5B;UNG;RAD51AP1;POLD3;ORC6;RAD21;POLD1;ORC2;POLD2;BARD1;DUT;XRCC6;RPA1;DONSON;RPA2;NAP1L1;POLA2;RAD50;RPA3;UBE2T;CDK1;RAN	DNA Metabolic Process 	GO:0006259	0	0.40027928	0.2732444	LLM	7.643856189774724	0.5508150092708347	0.12703488000000002	51	25.5	35	17.5

4. Integrins (ITGA2, ITGA5, ITGAV, ITGB1, ITGB3, ITGB5) and other cell adhesion molecules (e.g., CD44, VCAM1) mediate cell-ECM interactions, which are critical for cell migration, survival, and communication.

5. Growth factors and cytokines (e.g., TGFBI, TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFC, IL6) and their receptors (e.g., PDGFRB, TGFBR3) are key regulators of ECM synthesis and degradation, as well as modulators of cellular responses such as proliferation and differentiation.

6. Fibronectin (FN1), laminins (LAMA1, LAMA2, LAMA3, LAMC1, LAMC2), and elastin (ELN) are ECM proteins that contribute to the architecture and elasticity of the ECM, influencing tissue morphology and mechanics.

7. Additional proteins such as thrombospondins (THBS1, THBS2), tenascin (TNC), and osteopontin (SPP1) are involved in cell-matrix interactions and modulate cell behavior and tissue repair.

8. Several signaling molecules and transcription factors (e.g., SNAI2, JUN, NOTCH2) are implicated in the regulation of ECM components and in the response of cells to the ECM environment.

In summary, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the composition, structure, and dynamic remodeling of the ECM, as well as in the modulation of signals between the ECM and cells.

Given the diversity of functions and the lack of a clear common pathway or process, it is not possible to assign a specific biological process that is prominently performed by the majority of these proteins.

For instance, proteins like MYC, BCL2, and CCND1 are well-known for their roles in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. MYC is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many genes involved in cell proliferation, whereas BCL2 is an anti-apoptotic protein, and CCND1 (cyclin D1) is crucial for cell cycle progression. On the other hand, proteins such as SLC2A1 (GLUT1) and SLC22A5 (OCTN2) are involved in the transport of molecules across cell membranes, with GLUT1 facilitating glucose transport and OCTN2 being a carnitine transporter.

Additionally, proteins like RET and IGF1R are receptor tyrosine kinases that play significant roles in cell signaling and growth, while transcription factors such as XBP1 are involved in the unfolded protein response, a cellular stress response related to the endoplasmic reticulum.

The proteins ACAA1, ACAA2, ACADL, ACADM, ACADS, ACADVL, and ACAT2 are all involved in the breakdown of fatty acids through beta-oxidation. This process occurs in the mitochondria and peroxisomes, where fatty acids are converted into acetyl-CoA, which can then enter the citric acid cycle for energy production.

2. ACO2, ACOT2, ACOT8, and ACOX1 are also key components of fatty acid metabolism. ACOX1, in particular, is the first enzyme in the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway, which is responsible for the shortening of very long-chain fatty acids.

3. ACSL1, ACSL4, and ACSL5 are long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases that play a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism by converting free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters, which can then be metabolized or used in the synthesis of lipids.

4. CPT1A and CPT2 are carnitine palmitoyltransferases that are essential for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.

5. CRAT and CROT are carnitine acetyltransferases involved in the regulation of the acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio within the mitochondria, which is important for maintaining the balance between fatty acid oxidation and carbohydrate metabolism.

6. ECH1, ECHS1, ECI1, ECI2, and HADH are enzymes involved in various steps of the mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation spiral, further supporting the prominent role of this protein system in fatty acid catabolism.

7. HADHB is a subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, which is an enzyme complex that catalyzes the last three steps of mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids.

8. The presence of PPARA, a nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and metabolism, suggests a regulatory role for this protein system in the overall process.

To summarize, the majority of the proteins in this system are directly involved in the catabolism of fatty acids, particularly through the process of beta-oxidation, and the regulation of this metabolic pathway. The system appears to be highly integrated, with multiple enzymes working in concert to ensure efficient breakdown of fatty acids for energy production, indicating a strong focus on fatty acid oxidation and metabolism as the primary biological process."	0.92	0	22/49	5.07490236887148e-34	4.7602584220014505e-31	GCDH;ACADVL;ACOT8;ACAA2;ECHS1;ECI1;ECI2;ETFDH;HSD17B4;HSD17B10;ACAT2;HADHB;ACADL;AUH;CPT2;ACOX1;EHHADH;ACADM;ACAA1;ACADS;CRAT;DECR1	Fatty Acid Beta-Oxidation 	GO:0006635	0	0.86744744	0.74228406	LLM	7.303780748177103	0.2248049568175135	0.12516337999999994	22	13.924050632911392	24	15.18987341772152

IFIH1 is a cytoplasmic sensor of viral RNA that activates the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) to induce type I interferon production. OAS1 synthesizes 2',5'-oligoadenylates that activate RNase L, leading to RNA degradation in infected cells.

2. IRF1, IRF2, IRF7, and IRF9 are transcription factors that regulate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). They play a crucial role in the transcriptional activation of genes in response to interferon signaling.

3. ISG15, ISG20, MX1, RSAD2 (also known as viperin), and the TRIM family proteins (TRIM14, TRIM21, TRIM25, TRIM26, TRIM5) are ISGs with antiviral activities. ISG15 is involved in protein ISGylation, a ubiquitin-like modification that can disrupt viral replication. MX1 has GTPase activity and can block the replication of certain viruses. The TRIM proteins have various roles, including the regulation of innate immune signaling pathways and direct antiviral effects.

4. The proteins PSMB8 and PSMB9 are immunoproteasome subunits that are induced by interferon and are involved in the generation of antigenic peptides for presentation by MHC class I molecules, such as HLA-C, to cytotoxic T cells.

5. TAP1 is involved in the transport of antigenic peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecules.

6. The chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL11 are involved in the recruitment of immune cells to sites of infection or inflammation.

7. Proteins such as BST2 (tetherin) and IFITM proteins (IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3) have direct antiviral effects by inhibiting the release of budding viral particles or by blocking virus entry into host cells.

8. CASP1 and CASP8 are caspases involved in the inflammatory response and apoptosis, which can be part of the cellular response to viral infection.

9. CD74 is involved in antigen presentation and also serves as a receptor for the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), linking innate immunity to adaptive immune responses.

To summarize, the proteins in this set are predominantly involved in the innate immune response to viral infection and the subsequent activation of interferon signaling pathways. They function to detect viral components, inhibit viral replication, and activate immune cells, leading to the production of interferons and the expression of ISGs with antiviral activities. The system also includes components that are involved in antigen processing and presentation, further bridging innate and adaptive immunity. The high degree of interconnectedness and the shared roles in antiviral defense and interferon signaling justify the high confidence score."	0.95	0	33/189	4.3495709548655315e-43	3.292625212833207e-40	IFITM3;RTP4;IFITM1;IFITM2;DDX60;USP18;IFI44L;IFIT3;IFIT2;OASL;IFIH1;TRIM5;DHX58;CASP1;TRIM25;TRIM26;GBP2;TRIM21;RSAD2;STAT2;MX1;EIF2AK2;ISG15;ISG20;BST2;CXCL10;MOV10;PLSCR1;IFI27;OAS1;IRF1;IRF2;IRF7	Defense Response To Virus 	GO:0051607	0	0.69370496	0.5787958	LLM	6.599912842187128	0.2612677468381293	0.11490916000000007	33	34.02061855670103	30	30.927835051546392

1. Several proteins such as DDIT3 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3), also known as CHOP, and XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) are key components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, which is part of the unfolded protein response (UPR). These proteins are involved in restoring normal function of the cell by halting protein translation and activating signaling pathways that lead to increased production of molecular chaperones.

2. Proteins like HSP90B1, HSPA4, HSPA5, HSPA9, HSPD1, and HSPE1 are molecular chaperones that assist in protein folding and protect cells from stress by preventing aggregation of misfolded proteins.

3. Lipid metabolism is represented by proteins such as ACACA (acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha) and ACLY (ATP citrate lyase), which are crucial enzymes in fatty acid biosynthesis. SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is involved in the synthesis of monounsaturated fats from saturated fatty acids. FADS1 and FADS2 (fatty acid desaturases) are involved in the desaturation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

4. Cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation are highlighted by proteins such as HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, and INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1), which plays a role in the feedback regulation of cholesterol synthesis.

5. Proteins involved in redox homeostasis, such as G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and GSR (glutathione reductase), are critical for maintaining the cellular redox balance and protecting against oxidative stress.

6. The presence of multiple subunits of the proteasome (e.g., PSMA3, PSMA4, PSMB5, PSMC2, PSMC4, PSMC6, PSMD12, PSMD13, PSMD14, PSME3) and proteins involved in ubiquitination (e.g., UBE2D3) suggests a role in protein degradation and turnover, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and stress response.

The Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-Î²) pathway is a key regulator of various cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and specification of developmental fate. Proteins such as TGFB1, TGFBR1, and SMAD family members (SMAD1, SMAD3, SMAD6, SMAD7) are central to the TGF-Î² signaling cascade. Upon ligand binding, TGF-Î² receptors phosphorylate receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs), which then form complexes with SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression.

2. The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway, a branch of the TGF-Î² superfamily, is represented by proteins such as BMP2, BMPR1A, BMPR2, and SMAD1. This pathway is crucial for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis, influencing cell fate, proliferation, and apoptosis.

3. The process of EMT, where epithelial cells lose their characteristics and gain mesenchymal properties, is influenced by TGF-Î² signaling. Proteins such as CDH1 (E-cadherin) are downregulated during EMT, while others like SNAIL (not listed but often regulated by SMADs) are upregulated. This process is critical in development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis.

4. Negative regulation of TGF-Î² signaling is mediated by inhibitory SMADs (SMAD6 and SMAD7) and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of signaling components by SMURF1 and SMURF2. This ensures a tightly controlled response to TGF-Î² signaling.

5. The Wnt signaling pathway, which is involved in cell fate determination, is represented by proteins such as APC, CTNNB1 (Î²-catenin), and TCF/LEF family members (not listed but often associated with Î²-catenin). The interplay between TGF-Î² and Wnt signaling pathways is crucial for the regulation of EMT and cellular differentiation.

6. Crosstalk with other signaling pathways is evident through proteins like MAP3K7 (TAK1), which is involved in the NF-ÎºB pathway, and JUNB, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex. These interactions highlight the integration of TGF-Î² signaling with other cellular responses to environmental cues.

7. The system also includes proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling, such as HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1), ARID4B (a member of the SWI/SNF family), and NCOR2 (nuclear receptor corepressor 2), which can modulate the transcriptional outcomes of TGF-Î² signaling.

8. Several proteins in the system are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, such as CDKN1C (p57Kip2), which inhibits cyclin-CDK complexes, and CDK9, a component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, linking TGF-Î² signaling to cell cycle control.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are heavily involved in the TGF-Î² signaling pathway and its downstream effects, including the regulation of EMT. This system of proteins demonstrates a complex network of interactions that govern cellular responses to TGF-Î², mediate crosstalk with other signaling pathways, and regulate gene expression to control cell fate, proliferation, and differentiation."	0.94	0	21/130	9.427259531410516e-33	1.0954475575499017e-29	ACVR1;TGFB1;BMPR2;SMAD3;SMURF2;SMURF1;FURIN;LTBP2;SMAD6;TGFBR1;HIPK2;SMAD7;SKI;FKBP1A;BMP2;FNTA;ID1;MAP3K7;LEFTY2;BMPR1A;ENG	Transmembrane Receptor Protein Serine/Threonine Kinase Signaling Pathway 	GO:0007178	0	0.7433284	0.616875	LLM	5.754887502163468	0.2690215498739353	0.12645340000000005	21	38.88888888888889	21	38.88888888888889

The Wnt signaling pathway is a complex network of proteins that play crucial roles in embryonic development, cell proliferation, differentiation, and stem cell maintenance. Key components of this pathway include WNT1, WNT5B, WNT6 (ligands), FZD1, FZD8 (receptors), LRP5/6 (co-receptors), AXIN1, AXIN2, DVL2, and CTNNB1 (Î²-catenin). Upon Wnt ligand binding, the destruction complex (AXIN1, AXIN2, GSK3, CK1) is inhibited, leading to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of Î²-catenin (CTNNB1), which interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors (TCF7, LEF1) to activate Wnt target gene expression.

2. The Notch signaling pathway is another critical regulator of cell fate decisions, tissue homeostasis, and stem cell maintenance. It involves the interaction of Notch receptors (NOTCH1, NOTCH4) with their ligands (DLL1, JAG1, JAG2), leading to proteolytic cleavage by Î³-secretase (PSEN2) and release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The NICD translocates to the nucleus and associates with RBPJ to modulate gene transcription. HEY1 and HEY2 are examples of Notch-responsive genes.

3. The interplay between Wnt and Notch signaling pathways is evident in this system, as both pathways can influence each other and are often involved in similar cellular contexts, such as stem cell niches and cancer. For instance, AXIN2 is a target of the Wnt pathway and can also negatively regulate Notch signaling, while NOTCH signaling can influence the expression of Wnt target genes.

4. Cell cycle regulation is represented by proteins such as CCND2 (cyclin D2), which is involved in the G1/S transition, and SKP2, which is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, targeting proteins for degradation and thus controlling cell cycle progression. TP53 (p53) is a tumor suppressor that regulates the cell cycle and can induce apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

5. Crosstalk between these pathways and the cell cycle is mediated by several proteins. For example, MYC, a well-known proto-oncogene, is a target of Wnt signaling and can also influence cell cycle progression. HDACs (HDAC2, HDAC5, HDAC11) are involved in chromatin remodeling and can affect the transcription of Wnt/Notch target genes, while NCOR2 can interact with HDACs to repress transcription.

6. Negative regulation of Wnt signaling is performed by DKK1 and DKK4, which are antagonists that bind to LRP5/6 co-receptors, and by NKD1, which acts intracellularly. GNAI1 is a G protein involved in the non-canonical Wnt pathway, which also affects cell movement and polarity.

7. Additional regulation is provided by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation pathways, involving proteins such as CUL1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which can target Î²-catenin for degradation, thus modulating the intensity and duration of Wnt signaling.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, which are integrated with cell cycle regulation. These pathways are critical for controlling cell fate, proliferation, and differentiation, and their dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including cancer. The system reflects a tightly regulated network where multiple proteins contribute to the balance of signaling and cellular outcomes."	0.94	0	10/40	4.2369275783586065e-19	2.951406004414456e-16	JAG2;ADAM17;NOTCH1;JAG1;HEY1;MAML1;NOTCH4;HEY2;RBPJ;DLL1	Notch Signaling Pathway 	GO:0007219	0	0.6460779	0.6031543	Tied	5.392317422778761	0.09918100434028591	0.04292359999999995	10	23.809523809523807	33	78.57142857142857
