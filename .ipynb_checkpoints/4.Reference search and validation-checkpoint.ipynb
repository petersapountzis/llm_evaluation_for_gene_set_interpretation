      "Early-life diets may have a long-lasting impact on metabolic health. This study tested the hypothesis that an early-life diet with large, phospholipid-coated lipid droplets (Concept) induces sustained improvements of hepatic mitochondrial function and metabolism. Young C57BL/6j mice were fed Concept or control (CTRL) diet from postnatal day 15 (PN15) to PN42, followed by western style (WSD) or standard rodent diet (AIN) until PN98. Measurements comprised body composition, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle- and β-oxidation-related hepatic oxidative capacity using high-resolution respirometry, mitochondrial dynamics, mediators of insulin resistance (diacylglycerols, DAG) or ceramides) in subcellular compartments as well as systemic oxidative stress. Concept feeding increased TCA cycle-related respiration by 33% and mitochondrial fusion protein-1 by 65% at PN42 (both p 0.05). At PN98, CTRL, but not Concept, mice developed hyperinsulinemia (CTRL/AIN 0.22 ± 0.44 vs. CTRL/WSD 1.49 ± 0.53 nmol/l, p 0.05 and Concept/AIN 0.20 ± 0.38 vs. Concept/WSD 1.00 ± 0.29 nmol/l, n.s.) and insulin resistance after WSD (CTRL/AIN 107 ± 23 vs. CTRL/WSD 738 ± 284, p 0.05 and Concept/AIN 109 ± 24 vs. Concept/WSD 524 ± 157, n.s.). WSD-induced liver weight was 18% lower in adult Concept-fed mice and β-oxidation-related respiration was 69% higher (p 0.05; Concept/WSD vs. Concept/AIN) along with lower plasma lipid peroxides (CTRL/AIN 4.85 ± 0.28 vs. CTRL/WSD 5.73 ± 0.47 µmol/l, p 0.05 and Concept/AIN 4.49 ± 0.31 vs. Concept/WSD 4.42 ± 0.33 µmol/l, n.s.) and were in part protected from WSD-induced increase in hepatic cytosolic DAG C16:0/C18:1. Early-life feeding of Concept partly protected from WSD-induced insulin resistance and systemic oxidative stress, potentially via changes in specific DAG and mitochondrial function, highlighting the role of early life diets on metabolic health later in life.\n",

      "Essential fatty acids (EFA) and conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are unsaturated fatty acids with immune-modulatory effects, yet their synergistic effect is poorly understood in dairy cows. This study aimed at identifying differentially abundant proteins (DAP) and their associated pathways in dairy cows supplied with a combination of EFA and CLA during the transition from antepartum (AP) to early postpartum (PP). Sixteen Holstein cows were abomasally infused with coconut oil as a control (CTRL) or a mixture of EFA (linseed + safflower oil) and CLA (Lutalin, BASF) (EFA + CLA) from - 63 to + 63 days relative to parturition. Label-free quantitative proteomics was performed on plasma samples collected at days - 21, + 1, + 28, and + 63. During the transition time, DAP, consisting of a cluster of apolipoproteins (APO), including APOE, APOH, and APOB, along with a cluster of immune-related proteins, were related to complement and coagulation cascades, inflammatory response, and cholesterol metabolism. In response to EFA + CLA, specific APO comprising APOC3, APOA1, APOA4, and APOC4 were increased in a time-dependent manner; they were linked to triglyceride-enriched lipoprotein metabolisms and immune function. Altogether, these results provide new insights into metabolic and immune adaptation and crosstalk between them in transition dairy cows divergent in EFA + CLA status.\n",

      "Many inflammation-associated diseases, including cancers, increase in women after menopause and with obesity. In contrast to anti-inflammatory actions of 17β-estradiol, we find estrone, which dominates after menopause, is pro-inflammatory. In human mammary adipocytes, cytokine expression increases with obesity, menopause, and cancer. Adipocyte:cancer cell interaction stimulates estrone- and NFκB-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine upregulation. Estrone- and 17β-estradiol-driven transcriptomes differ. Estrone:ERα stimulates NFκB-mediated cytokine gene induction; 17β-estradiol opposes this. In obese mice, estrone increases and 17β-estradiol relieves inflammation. Estrone drives more rapid ER+ breast cancer growth in vivo. HSD17B14, which converts 17β-estradiol to estrone, associates with poor ER+ breast cancer outcome. Estrone and HSD17B14 upregulate inflammation, ALDH1 activity, and tumorspheres, while 17β-estradiol and HSD17B14 knockdown oppose these. Finally, a high intratumor estrone:17β-estradiol ratio increases tumor-initiating stem cells and ER+ cancer growth in vivo. These findings help explain why postmenopausal ER+ breast cancer increases with obesity, and offer new strategies for prevention and therapy.\n",

      "Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common estrogen-dependent gynecological malignancy in the developed World. To investigate the local formation of estradiol (E2), we first measured the concentrations of the steroid precursor androstenedione (A-dione) and the most potent estrogen, E2, and we evaluated the metabolism of A-dione, estrone-sulfate (E1-S), and estrone (E1) in cancerous and adjacent control endometrium. Furthermore, we studied expression of the key genes for estradiol formation via the aromatase and sulfatase pathways. A-dione and E2 were detected in cancerous and adjacent control endometrium. In cancerous endometrium, A-dione was metabolized to testosterone, and no E2 was formed. Both, E1-S and E1 were metabolized to E2, with increased levels of E2 seen in cancerous tissue. There was no significant difference in expression of the key genes of the aromatase (<i>CYP19A1</i>) and the sulfatase (<i>STS, HSD17B1, HSD17B2</i>) pathways in cancerous endometrium compared to adjacent control tissue. The mRNA levels of <i>CYP19A1</i> and <i>HSD17B1</i> were low, and <i>HSD17B14</i>, which promotes inactivation of E2, was significantly down-regulated in cancerous endometrium, especially in patients with lymphovascular invasion. At the protein level, there were no differences in the levels of STS and HSD17B2 between cancerous and adjacent control tissue by Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry revealed intense staining for STS and HSD17B2, and weak staining for SULT1E1 and HSD17B1 in cancerous tissue. Our data demonstrate that in cancerous endometrium, E2 is formed from E1-S <i>via</i> the sulfatase pathway, and not from A-dione <i>via</i> the aromatase pathway.\n",

      "17βHSD enzymes catalyze the stereospecific oxidation/reduction at carbon 17β of androgens and estrogens, and are important players in intracrine sex hormone synthesis. The biological relevance of 17βHSD14, first named retSDR3, is largely unknown. We generated and validated an antibody targeting the 17βHSD14 antigen and used this for immunohistochemical evaluation of expression patterns in 33 healthy human tissues. Furthermore, sex steroid conversional activity in HSD17B14 overexpressing HEK293 and MCF10A cells was investigated by assessing interconversion products of estrone, estradiol, androstenedione, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone. Immunohistochemical staining patterns of 17βHSD14 with the enzyme being primarily expressed in glandular epithelial tissue reveal an enzyme with possible implications in the secretion or conversion of externally derived compounds. A role for 17βHSD14 in sex steroid metabolism is supported by the finding that 17HSD14 oxidizes both estradiol and testosterone into less bioactive steroid metabolites estrone and androstenedione, respectively.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The high mortality rates associated with ovarian cancer are largely due to a lack of highly effective treatment options for advanced stage disease; a time when initial diagnosis most commonly occurs. Recent evidence suggests that the steroid hormone, progesterone, may possess anti-tumorigenic properties. With the discovery of a new class of membrane-bound progesterone receptors (mPRs) belonging to the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) gene family in the ovary, there are undefined mechanisms by which progesterone may inhibit tumor progression. Therefore, our goal was to define potential mPR-dependent signaling mechanisms operative in ovarian cancer cells. We detected abundant mPRα (PAQR7), mPRβ (PAQR8), and mPRγ (PAQR5), but not classical nuclear PR (A or B isoforms) mRNA expression and mPRα protein expression in a panel of commonly used ovarian cancer cell lines. In contrast to mPR action in breast cancer cells, progesterone alone failed to induce changes in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in ovarian cancer cells. However, progesterone enhanced cAMP production by β(1,2)-adrenergic receptors and increased isoproterenol-induced transcription from a cAMP response element (CRE)-driven reporter gene. Independently of β-adrenergic signaling, we additionally observed activation of both JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK in response to progesterone alone. This finding was supported by the results of a screen for potential mPR gene targets. Progesterone induced a significant increase in transcription of the pro-apoptotic marker BAX, whose activity and expression has been linked to JNK1/2 and p38 signaling. Inhibitors of JNK, but not p38, blocked progesterone-induced BAX expression. Taken together, these observations implicate at least two distinct signaling pathways that may be utilized by mPRs in ovarian cancer cells that exhibit regulatory genomic changes. These studies on mPR signaling in ovarian cancer lay the foundation for future work aimed at understanding how progesterone exerts its anti-tumorigenic effects in the ovary and suggest that pharmacologic activation of mPRs, abundantly expressed in ovarian cancers, may provide a new treatment option for patients with advanced stage disease.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Recently, sex steroid membrane receptors garnered world-wide attention because they may be related to sex hormone-mediated unknown rapid non-genomic action that cannot be currently explained by their genomic action via nuclear receptors. Progesterone affects cell proliferation and survival via non-genomic effects. In this process, membrane progesterone receptors (mPRα, mPRβ, mPRγ, mPRδ, and mPRε) were identified as putative G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for progesterone. However, the structure, intracellular signaling, and physiological functions of these progesterone receptors are still unclear. Here, we identify a molecular mechanism by which progesterone promotes neurite outgrowth through mPRβ (Paqr8) activation. Mouse mPRβ mRNA was specifically expressed in the central nervous system. It has an incomplete GPCR topology, presenting 6 transmembrane domains and did not exhibit typical GPCR signaling. Progesterone-dependent neurite outgrowth was exhibited by the promotion of ERK phosphorylation via mPRβ, but not via other progesterone receptors such as progesterone membrane receptor 1 (PGRMC-1) and nuclear progesterone receptor in nerve growth factor-induced neuronal PC12 cells. These findings provide new insights of regarding the non-genomic action of progesterone in the central nervous system.\n",

      "Oocyte maturation (OM) in goldfish is induced by the maturation inducing hormone (MIH) via its membrane receptor. Previously, we described the cloning of the membrane progesterone receptor alpha (mPRα or paqr7b) cDNA from a goldfish ovarian cDNA library and obtained experimental evidence that the mPRα protein is an intermediary in MIH induction of OM in goldfish. Three mPR subtypes have been identified in fish by cDNA cloning or by in silico analysis of genome sequence databases. In order to investigate the potential roles of the mPR subtypes in oocyte maturation, we cloned additional mPRs from a goldfish ovarian cDNA library. RACE amplification, and screening of the cDNA library identified one β (paqr8) and two γ subtypes (paqr5) (hereafter referred to as γ-1 and γ-2), respectively. Tissue distribution of mPR subtypes showed differential expression pattern. However, in addition to mPRα, the β, γ-1 and γ-2 subtypes were also expressed in follicle-enclosed oocytes. Cell lines expressing the β, γ-1 and γ-2 genes were established and their steroid binding properties compared. The β subtype exhibited higher binding affinity than the γ subtypes for 17,20β-DHP, the MIH in goldfish. Microinjection of goldfish oocytes with a morpholino antisense oligonucleotide to mPRβ blocked the induction of oocyte maturational competence, whereas injection of antisense oliogonucleotides to mPRγ-1 and γ-2 were ineffective. These results suggest that the goldfish mPRβ protein acts as an intermediary during MIH induction of OM in goldfish, in a manner similar to that described previously for mPRα.\n",

      "Postprandial hyperglycemia is an early indicator of abnormality in glucose metabolism leading to type 2 diabetes. However, mechanisms that contribute to postprandial hyperglycemia have not been identified. This study showed that mice with targeted inactivation of the group 1B phospholipase A2 (Pla2g1b) gene displayed lower postprandial glycemia than that observed in wild-type mice after being fed a glucose-rich meal. The difference was caused by enhanced postprandial glucose uptake by the liver, heart, and muscle tissues as well as altered postprandial hepatic glucose metabolism in the Pla2g1b-/- mice. These differences were attributed to a fivefold decrease in the amount of dietary phospholipids absorbed as lysophospholipids in Pla2g1b-/- mice compared with that observed in Pla2g1b+/+ mice. Elevating plasma lysophospholipid levels in Pla2g1b-/- mice via intraperitoneal injection resulted in glucose intolerance similar to that exhibited by Pla2g1b+/+ mice. Studies with cultured hepatoma cells revealed that lysophospholipids dose-dependently suppressed insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. These results demonstrated that reduction of lysophospholipid absorption enhances insulin-mediated glucose metabolism and is protective against postprandial hyperglycemia.\n",

      "Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting diet-induced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b(+/+) and Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, PPAR-delta, PPAR-gamma, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained through concerted action of the SREBPs and LXRs. Here, we report that RNF145, a previously uncharacterized ER membrane ubiquitin ligase, participates in crosstalk between these critical signaling pathways. RNF145 expression is induced in response to LXR activation and high-cholesterol diet feeding. Transduction of RNF145 into mouse liver inhibits the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and reduces plasma cholesterol levels. Conversely, acute suppression of RNF145 via shRNA-mediated knockdown, or chronic inactivation of RNF145 by genetic deletion, potentiates the expression of cholesterol biosynthetic genes and increases cholesterol levels both in liver and plasma. Mechanistic studies show that RNF145 triggers ubiquitination of SCAP on lysine residues within a cytoplasmic loop essential for COPII binding, potentially inhibiting its transport to Golgi and subsequent processing of SREBP-2. These findings define an additional mechanism linking hepatic sterol levels to the reciprocal actions of the SREBP-2 and LXR pathways.\n",

      "The effects of the consumption of high-fat diets (HFD) have been studied to unravel the molecular pathways they are altering in order to understand the link between increased caloric intake, metabolic diseases, and the risk of cognitive dysfunction. The saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid (PA), is the main component of HFD and it has been found increased in the circulation of obese and diabetic people. In the central nervous system, PA has been associated with inflammatory responses in astrocytes, but the effects on neurons exposed to it have not been largely investigated. Given that PA affects a variety of metabolic pathways, we aimed to analyze the transcriptomic profile activated by this fatty acid to shed light on the mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction. In the current study, we profiled the transcriptome response after PA exposition at non-toxic doses in primary hippocampal neurons. Gene ontology and Reactome pathway analysis revealed a pattern of gene expression which is associated with inflammatory pathways, and importantly, with the activation of lipid metabolism that is considered not very active in neurons. Validation by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) of Hmgcs2, Angptl4, Ugt8, and Rnf145 support the results obtained by RNAseq. Overall, these findings suggest that neurons are able to respond to saturated fatty acids changing the expression pattern of genes associated with inflammatory response and lipid utilization that may be involved in the neuronal damage associated with metabolic diseases.\n",

      "Lipids are key components in the viral life cycle that affect host-pathogen interactions. In this study, we investigated the effect of HCV infection on sphingolipid metabolism, especially on endogenous SM levels, and the relationship between HCV replication and endogenous SM molecular species. We demonstrated that HCV induces the expression of the genes (SGMS1 and 2) encoding human SM synthases 1 and 2. We observed associated increases of both total and individual sphingolipid molecular species, as assessed in human hepatocytes and in the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fraction in which HCV replicates. SGMS1 expression had a correlation with HCV replication. Inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis with a hepatotropic serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) inhibitor, NA808, suppressed HCV-RNA production while also interfering with sphingolipid metabolism. Further, we identified the SM molecular species that comprise the DRM fraction and demonstrated that these endogenous SM species interacted with HCV nonstructural 5B polymerase to enhance viral replication. Our results reveal that HCV alters sphingolipid metabolism to promote viral replication, providing new insights into the formation of the HCV replication complex and the involvement of host lipids in the HCV life cycle.\n",

      "The imbalance in sphingolipid signaling may be critically linked to the upstream events in the neurodegenerative cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We analyzed the influence of mutant (V717I) amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP) transgene on sphingolipid metabolism enzymes in mouse hippocampus. At 3 months of age AβPP/Aβ presence upregulated enzymes of ceramide turnover on the salvage pathway: ceramide synthases (CERS2, CERS4, CERS6) and also ceramidase ACER3. At 6 months, only CERS6 was elevated, and no ceramide synthase was increased at 12 months. However, sphingomyelin synthases, which utilize ceramide on the sphingomyelinase pathway, were reduced (SGMS1 at 12 and SGMS2 at 6 months). mRNAs for sphingomyelin synthases SGMS1 and SGMS2 were also significantly downregulated in human AD hippocampus and neocortex when compared with age-matched controls. Our findings suggest early-phase deregulation of sphingolipid homeostasis in favor of ceramide signaling. Fingolimod (FTY720), a modulator of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors countered the AβPP-dependent upregulation of hippocampal ceramide synthase CERS2 at 3 months. Moreover, at 12 months, FTY720 increased enzymes of ceramide-sphingosine turnover: CERS4, ASAH1, and ACER3. We also observed influence of fingolimod on the expression of the sphingomyelinase pathway enzymes. FTY720 counteracted the AβPP-linked reduction of sphingomyelin synthases SGMS1/2 (at 12 and 6 months, respectively) and led to elevation of sphingomyelinase SMPD2 (at 6 and 12 months). Therefore, our results demonstrate potentially beneficial, age-specific effects of fingolimod on transcription of sphingolipid metabolism enzymes in an animal model of AD.\n",

      "This study aimed to explore underlying mechanisms by which sphingolipid-related genes play a role in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and construct a new prognosis-related risk model. We used a variety of bioinformatics methods and databases to complete our exploration. Based on the TCGA database, we used multiple R-based extension packages for data transformation, processing, and statistical analyses. First, on analyzing the CNV, SNV, and mRNA expression of 29 sphingolipid-related genes in various types of cancers, we found that the vast majority were protective in KIRC. Subsequently, we performed cluster analysis of patients with KIRC using sphingolipid-related genes and successfully classified them into the following three clusters with significant prognostic differences: Cluster 1, Cluster 2, and Cluster 3. We performed differential analyses of transcription factor activity, drug sensitivity, immune cell infiltration, and classical oncogenes to elucidate the unique roles of sphingolipid-related genes in cancer, especially KIRC, and provide a reference for clinical treatment. After analyzing the risk rates of sphingolipid-related genes in KIRC, we successfully established a risk model composed of seven genes using LASSO regression analysis, including SPHK1, CERS5, PLPP1, SGMS1, SGMS2, SERINC1, and KDSR. Previous studies have suggested that these genes play important biological roles in sphingolipid metabolism. ROC curve analysis results showed that the risk model provided good prediction accuracy. Based on this risk model, we successfully classified patients with KIRC into high- and low-risk groups with significant prognostic differences. In addition, we performed correlation analyses combined with clinicopathological data and found a significant correlation between the risk model and patient's M, T, stage, grade, and fustat. Finally, we developed a nomogram that predicted the 5-, 7-, and 10-year survival in patients with KIRC. The model we constructed had strong predictive ability. In conclusion, we believe that this study provides valuable data and clues for future studies on sphingolipid-related genes in KIRC.\n",

The four LATs, LAT1 (SLC7A5), LAT2 (SLC7A8), LAT3 (SLC43A1) and LAT4 (SLC43A2), are responsible for the majority of cellular leucine uptake. They show increased expression in many cancers, and are critical for control of protein translation and cell growth through the mTORC1 pathway. The increased transporter expression observed in cancers is regulated by transcriptional pathways such as hormone receptors, c-myc and nutrient starvation responses. We review the expression and function of the LAT family in cancer, as well as the recent development of specific inhibitors targeting LAT1 or LAT3. These LAT family inhibitors may be useful adjuvant therapeutics in multiple cancers.\n",

      "LAT2 (system L amino acid transporter 2) is composed of the subunits Slc7a8/Lat2 and Slc3a2/4F2hc. This transporter is highly expressed along the basolateral membranes of absorptive epithelia in kidney and small intestine, but is also abundant in the brain. Lat2 is an energy-independent exchanger of neutral amino acids, and was shown to transport thyroid hormones. We report in the present paper that targeted inactivation of Slc7a8 leads to increased urinary loss of small neutral amino acids. Development and growth of Slc7a8(-/-) mice appears normal, suggesting functional compensation of neutral amino acid transport by alternative transporters in kidney, intestine and placenta. Movement co-ordination is slightly impaired in mutant mice, although cerebellar development and structure remained inconspicuous. Circulating thyroid hormones, thyrotropin and thyroid hormone-responsive genes remained unchanged in Slc7a8(-/-) mice, possibly because of functional compensation by the thyroid hormone transporter Mct8 (monocarboxylate transporter 8), which is co-expressed in many cell types. The reason for the mild neurological phenotype remains unresolved.\n",

      "Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most common sensory deficit in the elderly. The disease has a multifactorial etiology with both environmental and genetic factors involved being largely unknown. SLC7A8/SLC3A2 heterodimer is a neutral amino acid exchanger. Here, we demonstrated that SLC7A8 is expressed in the mouse inner ear and that its ablation resulted in ARHL, due to the damage of different cochlear structures. These findings make SLC7A8 transporter a strong candidate for ARHL in humans. Thus, a screening of a cohort of ARHL patients and controls was carried out revealing several variants in <i>SLC7A8</i>, whose role was further investigated by in vitro functional studies. Significant decreases in SLC7A8 transport activity was detected for patient's variants (p.Val302Ile, p.Arg418His, p.Thr402Met and p.Val460Glu) further supporting a causative role for SLC7A8 in ARHL. Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that a relevant proportion of ARHL cases could be explained by SLC7A8 mutations.\n",

      "The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway facilitates the degradation of damaged proteins and regulates growth and stress response. This pathway is activated in various cancers, including breast cancer. We have previously reported that the novel human gene, UBE2Q2, is a putative ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that is located on chromosome 15 and is overexpressed in tumor mass and invasive epithelium in head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma. Here, real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate the expression levels of UBE2Q2 gene in a collection of 21 breast cancer tissues matched with normal adjacent counterparts. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot testing were also performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections by using a rabbit polyclonal antibody that we generated against an amino acid sequence predicted from the DNA sequence of UBE2Q2 gene. In the 21 cases investigated, a high increase in the expression of UBE2Q2 mRNA was found in 8 breast cancers (38.1%), a moderately increased UBE2Q2 expression was observed in 7 cases (33.3%), and no significant changes were detected in 6 cases (28.6%) of tumor samples when compared with corresponding normal tissues. Consistently, a higher level of immunoreactivity for UBE2Q2 protein was detected in invasive epithelium of cancerous tissues when compared with that in the normal epithelium. Our data suggest that the novel human gene UBE2Q2 may have implications for pathogenesis of breast cancer and could be used in molecular diagnosis purposes in the future.\n",

      "Activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in various malignancies, including colorectal cancer, is established. This pathway mediates the degradation of damaged proteins and regulates growth and stress response. The novel human gene, UBE2Q2, with a putative ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme activity, is reported to be overexpressed in some malignancies. We sought to investigate the expression levels of the UBE2Q2 gene in colorectal cell lines as well as in cancerous and normal tissues from patients with colorectal cancer.\n",
      "Levels of UBE2Q2 mRNA in cell lines were assessed by Real-Time PCR. Western blotting was employed to investigate the levels of the UBE2Q2 protein in 8 colorectal cell lines and 43 colorectal tumor samples.\n",
      "Expression of UBE2Q2 was observed at the level of both mRNA and protein in colorectal cell lines, HT29/219, LS180, SW742, Caco2, HTC116, SW48, SW480, and SW1116. Increased levels of UBE2Q2 immunoreactivity was observed in the 65.11% (28 out of 43) of the colorectal carcinoma tissues when compared with their corresponding normal tissues. Difference between the mean intensities of UBE2Q2 bands from cancerous and normal tissues was statistically significant at P<0.001 (paired t test).\n",
      "We showed the expression pattern of the novel human gene, UBE2Q2, in 8 colorectal cell lines. Overexpression of UBE2Q2 in the majority of the colorectal carcinoma samples denotes that it may have implications for the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays an important role in protein degradation. The process of ubiquitination requires ubiquitin activating enzyme E1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, and ubiquitin ligase E3 to complete the coordination. Our previous studies have shown that HUWE1 (HECT, UBA and WWE domain containing 1), as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, can degrade epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to inhibit renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. However, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes binding to HUWE1 are still unclear. The aim of the present study was to identify E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes of HUWE1. Real-time PCR was used to identify E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that may interact with HUWE1. The expression of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme was detected in kidney of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice and HK-2 cells treated with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). The results showed that the expressions of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2Q2 were significantly down-regulated at both RNA and protein levels in UUO kidneys. The expression of UBE2Q2 was also down-regulated in HK-2 cells stimulated with TGF-β, which was consistent with the change in the expression of HUWE1. These findings indicated that UBE2Q2 expression was synergistic with HUWE1 in the injured kidney. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments showed that HUWE1 interacted with UBE2Q2 in HK-2 cells. The co-localization of UBE2Q2 and HUWE1 was confirmed by cell immunofluorescence staining. After knocking down UBE2Q2 by siRNA, ubiquitin binding to HUWE1 and EGFR was decreased. In sum, our results demonstrated that UBE2Q2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, works with HUWE1 to mediate ubiquitination and degradation of target protein in kidney.\n",

      "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is one of the most important factors in systemic lipid partitioning and metabolism. It mediates intravascular hydrolysis of triglycerides packed in lipoproteins such as chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Since its initial discovery in the 1940s, its biology and pathophysiological significance have been well characterized. Nonetheless, several studies in the past decade, with recent delineation of LPL crystal structure and the discovery of several new regulators such as angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs), glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1), lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1) and Sel-1 suppressor of Lin-12-like 1 (SEL1L), have completely transformed our understanding of LPL biology.\n",

      "Hypertriglyceridemia, a commonly encountered phenotype in cardiovascular and metabolic clinics, is surprisingly complex. A range of genetic variants, from single-nucleotide variants to large-scale copy number variants, can lead to either the severe or mild-to-moderate forms of the disease. At the genetic level, severely elevated triglyceride levels resulting from familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) are caused by homozygous or biallelic loss-of-function variants in <i>LPL, APOC2, APOA5, LMF1</i>, and <i>GPIHBP1</i> genes. In contrast, susceptibility to multifactorial chylomicronemia (MCM), which has an estimated prevalence of ~1 in 600 and is at least 50-100-times more common than FCS, results from two different types of genetic variants: (1) rare heterozygous variants (minor allele frequency <1%) with variable penetrance in the five causal genes for FCS; and (2) common variants (minor allele frequency >5%) whose individually small phenotypic effects are quantified using a polygenic score. There is indirect evidence of similar complex genetic predisposition in other clinical phenotypes that have a component of hypertriglyceridemia, such as combined hyperlipidemia and dysbetalipoproteinemia. Future considerations include: (1) evaluation of whether the specific type of genetic predisposition to hypertriglyceridemia affects medical decisions or long-term outcomes; and (2) searching for other genetic contributors, including the role of genome-wide polygenic scores, novel genes, non-linear gene-gene or gene-environment interactions, and non-genomic mechanisms including epigenetics and mitochondrial DNA.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Mutations in lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1) are associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia in mice and human subjects. The underlying cause is impaired lipid clearance due to lipase deficiency. LMF1 is a chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and it is critically required for the post-translational activation of three vascular lipases: lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hepatic lipase (HL) and endothelial lipase (EL). As LMF1 is only required for the maturation of homodimeric, but not monomeric, lipases, it is likely involved in the assembly of inactive lipase subunits into active enzymes and/or the stabilization of active dimers. Herein, we provide an overview of current understanding of LMF1 function and propose that it may play a regulatory role in lipase activation and lipid metabolism. Further studies will be required to test this hypothesis and elucidate the full spectrum of phenotypes in combined lipase deficiency.

      "Malignant fibrous histiocytoma amplified sequence 1 (MFHAS1) is a predicted oncoprotein that demonstrates tumorigenic activity in vivo; however, the mechanisms involved are unknown. Macrophages are divided into the pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory/protumoral M2 subtypes. Tumor cells can induce M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to promote metastasis; but the underlying pathways require to be elucidated. In this study, we detected a positive association between MFHAS1 expression in TAMs and human colorectal cancer (CRC) TNM stage. Supernatant of CT26 murine CRC cells induced MFHAS1 expression in RAW264.7 murine macrophages. Additionally, CT26 supernatant induced the M2 marker CD206 and activated the pro-M2 STAT6 and KLF4 signaling in control but not MFHAS1-silenced RAW264.7 macrophages. Moreover, supernatant of control, but not MFHAS1-silenced macrophages promoted CT26 cell proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Compared with control macrophages, MFHAS1-silenced macrophages showed significantly reduced protumoral effects in vivo. Together, these results suggested that CRC cells induce M2 polarization of TAMs through MFHAS1 induction and subsequent STAT6 and KLF4 activation to promote CRC progress. Finally, similar to CT26 supernatant stimulation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) activation by rosiglitazone induced M2 polarization of RAW264.7 macrophages through MFHAS1-dependent pathway. Our results highlight the role of MFHAS1 as a regulator of macrophages polarization and CRC progress.\n",

      "Malignant fibrous histiocytoma amplified sequence 1 (MFHAS1) has a potential immunoregulatory role dependent on Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLR2, associated with deleterious systemic inflammation, cardiac dysfunction, and acute kidney injury, acts synergistically in sepsis. The role of MFHAS1 in targeting TLR2 involved in sepsis has not been examined thus far. This study aimed to examine the relationship of MFHAS1 and sepsis, and the effect of MFHAS1 on the TLR2 signaling pathway. Blood samples were collected from eight sepsis patients after surgery and eight patients undergoing selective surgery to determine blood MFHAS1 levels. HEK 293 cells, RAW 264.7 macrophages and THP-1 monocytes were used to confirm the effect of MFHAS1 on TLR2 signaling pathway. Our study showed that blood MFHAS1 was significantly elevated in septic patients, and MFHAS1 was more increased in mononuclear cells from septic patients. Pam3CSK4 (TLR2 ligand) was found to induce MFHAS1 production in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages and THP-1 human monocytes in a time-dependent manner. MFHAS1 has dual effects on TLR2 signaling pathway and inflammation, i.e., inhibitory effect at 6 hours, and then stimulatory effect after 24 hours through the activation of TLR2/NF-κB signaling pathway, and MFHAS1 induced the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 after TLR2 stimulation.\n",

The aim of this study was to explore the role of malignant fibrous histiocytoma amplified sequence 1 (MFHAS1) in high-glucose induced inflammation. Our research showed that high glucose stimulated the expression of MFHAS1, and overexpression of MFHAS1 can attenuate high-glucose induced inflammation in endothelial cells by decreasing the secretion of cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-1α (IL-1α), adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL-1). Furthermore, we found that MFHAS1 promoted the phosphorylation of Akt and the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Our results indicated that MFHAS1 deadened high-glucose induced inflammation by activating AKT/HO-1 pathway, suggesting that MFHAS1 may act as a new therapeutic target of diabetes mellitus.\n",

MAIT cells use a limited T cell antigen receptor (TCR) repertoire with public antigen specificities that are conserved across species. They can be activated by TCR-dependent and TCR-independent mechanisms and exhibit rapid, innate-like effector responses.

      "Mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are striking in their abundance and their strict conservation across 150 million years of mammalian evolution, implying they must fulfill critical immunological function(s). MAIT cells are defined by their expression of a semi-invariant αβ TCR which recognizes biosynthetic derivatives of riboflavin synthesis presented on MR1. Initial studies focused on their role in detecting predominantly intracellular bacterial and mycobacterial infections. However, it is now recognized that there are several modes of MAIT cell activation and these are related to activation of distinct transcriptional programmes, each associated with distinct functional roles. In this minireview, we summarize current knowledge from human and animal studies of MAIT cell activation induced (1) in an MR1-TCR dependent manner in the context of inflammatory danger signals and associated with antibacterial host defense; (2) in an MR1-TCR independent manner by the cytokines interleukin(IL)-12/-15/-18 and type I interferon, which is associated with antiviral responses; and (3) a recently-described TCR-dependent \"tissue repair\" programme which is associated with accelerated wound healing in the context of commensal microbiota. Because of this capability for diverse functional responses in diverse immunological contexts, these intriguing cells now appear to be multifunctional effectors central to the interface of innate and adaptive immunity.\n",

      "Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting diet-induced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b(+/+) and Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, PPAR-delta, PPAR-gamma, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Excessive absorption of products of dietary fat digestion leads to type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related disorders. Mice deficient in the group 1B phospholipase A₂ (Pla2g1b), a gut digestive enzyme, are protected against diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes without displaying dietary lipid malabsorption. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Pla2g1b protects against diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Results showed that the Pla2g1b(-/-) mice had decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice subsequent to feeding a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (hypercaloric) diet. These differences were evident before differences in body weight gains were observed. Injection of Poloxamer 407 to inhibit lipolysis revealed decreased VLDL production in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. Supplementation with lysophosphatidylcholine, the product of Pla2g1b hydrolysis, restored VLDL production rates in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice and further elevated VLDL production in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed decreased postprandial lipidemia compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. These results show that, in addition to dietary fatty acids, gut-derived lysophospholipids derived from Pla2g1b hydrolysis of dietary and biliary phospholipids also promote hepatic VLDL production. Thus, the inhibition of lysophospholipid absorption via Pla2g1b inactivation may prove beneficial against diet-induced hyperlipidemia in addition to the protection against obesity and diabetes.\n",

      "Immunity to intestinal helminth infections has been well studied, but the mechanism of helminth killing prior to expulsion remains unclear. Here we identify epithelial-cell-derived phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> group 1B (PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B) as a host-derived endogenous anthelmintic. PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B is elevated in resistant mice and is responsible for killing tissue-embedded larvae. Despite comparable activities of other essential type-2-dependent immune mechanisms, Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to expel the intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Expression of Pla2g1b by epithelial cells was dependent upon intestinal microbiota, adaptive immunity, and common-gamma chain-dependent signaling. Notably, Pla2g1b was downregulated in susceptible mice and inhibited by IL-4R-signaling in vitro, uncoupling parasite killing from expulsion mechanisms. Resistance was restored in Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice by treating infective H. polygyrus L3 larvae with PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B, which reduced larval phospholipid abundance. These findings uncover epithelial-cell-derived Pla2g1b as an essential mediator of helminth killing, highlighting a previously overlooked mechanism of anti-helminth immunity.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Mammalian HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and the therapeutic target of statins, is post-transcriptionally regulated by sterol-accelerated degradation. Under cholesterol-replete conditions, HMGCR is ubiquitinated and degraded, but the identity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) responsible for mammalian HMGCR turnover remains controversial. Using systematic, unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screens with a sterol-sensitive endogenous HMGCR reporter, we comprehensively map the E3 ligase landscape required for sterol-accelerated HMGCR degradation. We find that RNF145 and gp78 independently co-ordinate HMGCR ubiquitination and degradation. RNF145, a sterol-responsive ER-resident E3 ligase, is unstable but accumulates following sterol depletion. Sterol addition triggers RNF145 recruitment to HMGCR via Insigs, promoting HMGCR ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. In the absence of both RNF145 and gp78, Hrd1, a third UBE2G2-dependent E3 ligase, partially regulates HMGCR activity. Our findings reveal a critical role for the sterol-responsive RNF145 in HMGCR regulation and elucidate the complexity of sterol-accelerated HMGCR degradation.\n",

      "Cholesterol biosynthesis is tightly regulated in the cell. For example, high sterol concentrations can stimulate degradation of the rate-limiting cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase, HMGCR). HMGCR is broken down by the endoplasmic reticulum membrane-associated protein complexes consisting of insulin-induced genes (Insigs) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase gp78. Here we found that HMGCR degradation is partially blunted in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells lacking gp78 (<i>gp78</i>-KO). To identify other ubiquitin ligase(s) that may function together with gp78 in triggering HMGCR degradation, we performed a small-scale short hairpin RNA-based screening targeting endoplasmic reticulum-localized E3s. We found that knockdown of both <i>ring finger protein 145</i> (<i>Rnf145</i>) and <i>gp78</i> genes abrogates sterol-induced degradation of HMGCR in CHO cells. We also observed that RNF145 interacts with Insig-1 and -2 proteins and ubiquitinates HMGCR. Moreover, the tetrapeptide sequence YLYF in the sterol-sensing domain and the Cys-537 residue in the RING finger domain were essential for RNF145 binding to Insigs and RNF145 E3 activity, respectively. Of note, amino acid substitutions in the YLYF or of Cys-537 completely abolished RNF145-mediated HMGCR degradation. In summary, our study reveals that RNF145, along with gp78, promotes HMGCR degradation in response to elevated sterol levels and identifies residues essential for RNF145 function.\n",

      "Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained through concerted action of the SREBPs and LXRs. Here, we report that RNF145, a previously uncharacterized ER membrane ubiquitin ligase, participates in crosstalk between these critical signaling pathways. RNF145 expression is induced in response to LXR activation and high-cholesterol diet feeding. Transduction of RNF145 into mouse liver inhibits the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and reduces plasma cholesterol levels. Conversely, acute suppression of RNF145 via shRNA-mediated knockdown, or chronic inactivation of RNF145 by genetic deletion, potentiates the expression of cholesterol biosynthetic genes and increases cholesterol levels both in liver and plasma. Mechanistic studies show that RNF145 triggers ubiquitination of SCAP on lysine residues within a cytoplasmic loop essential for COPII binding, potentially inhibiting its transport to Golgi and subsequent processing of SREBP-2. These findings define an additional mechanism linking hepatic sterol levels to the reciprocal actions of the SREBP-2 and LXR pathways.\n",

      "Glucose transporter 6 (GLUT6) is a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family. GLUT6 is upregulated in several cancers but is not widely expressed in normal tissues. Previous studies have shown that GLUT6 knockdown kills endometrial cancer cells that express elevated levels of the protein. However, whether GLUT6 represents a viable anticancer drug target is unclear because the role of GLUT6 in normal metabolic physiology is unknown. Herein we generated GLUT6 knockout mice to determine how loss of GLUT6 affected whole body glucose homeostasis and metabolic physiology. We found that the mouse GLUT6 ( Slc2a6) gene expression pattern was similar to humans with mRNA found primarily in brain and spleen. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of Slc2a6 did not alter mouse development, growth, or whole body glucose metabolism in male or female mice fed either a chow diet or Western diet. GLUT6 deletion did not impact glucose tolerance or blood glucose and insulin levels in male or female mice fed either diet. However, compared with wild-type littermate controls, GLUT6 null female mice had a relatively minor decrease in fat accumulation when fed Western diet and had a lower respiratory exchange ratio when fed chow diet. Collectively, these data show that GLUT6 is not a major regulator of whole body metabolic physiology; therefore, GLUT6 inhibition may have minimal adverse effects if targeted for cancer therapy.\n",

      "Obesity-related insulin resistance is a highly prevalent and growing health concern, which places stress on the pancreatic islets of Langerhans by increasing insulin secretion to lower blood glucose levels. The glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3 play a key role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in human islets, while GLUT2 is the key isoform in rodent islets. However, it is unclear whether other glucose transporters also contribute to insulin secretion by pancreatic islets. Herein, we show that <i>SLC2A6</i> (<i>GLUT6</i>) is markedly upregulated in pancreatic islets from genetically obese leptin-mutant (<i>ob/ob</i>) and leptin receptor-mutant (<i>db/db</i>) mice, compared to lean controls. Furthermore, we observe that islet <i>SLC2A6</i> expression positively correlates with body mass index in human patients with type 2 diabetes. To investigate whether <i>GLUT6</i> plays a functional role in islets, we crossed <i>GLUT6</i> knockout mice with C57BL/6 <i>ob/ob</i> mice. Pancreatic islets isolated from <i>ob/ob</i> mice lacking <i>GLUT6</i> secreted more insulin in response to high-dose glucose, compared to <i>ob/ob</i> mice that were wild type for <i>GLUT6</i>. The loss of <i>GLUT6</i> in <i>ob/ob</i> mice had no adverse impact on body mass, body composition, or glucose tolerance at a whole-body level. This study demonstrates that <i>GLUT6</i> plays a role in pancreatic islet insulin secretion in vitro but is not a dominant glucose transporter that alters whole-body metabolic physiology in <i>ob/ob</i> mice.\n",

      "Prostate cancer is a health-threaten disease in men worldwide, however, lacking is the reliable biomarkers for patient management. Aberrant metabolic events including glucose metabolism are involved in prostate cancer progression. To examine the involvement of glucose metabolic pathways in prostate cancer, we analyzed the expression profiles of glucose transporter family genes using multiple RNA-seq datasets. Our results showed that three SLC2A family genes (SLC2A4/5/9) were significantly downregulated in primary prostate cancers compared to their benign compartments. These down-regulated expressions were inversely correlated with their gene promoter methylation and genome abnormalities. Among these three SLC2A genes, only SLC2A4 showed a significantly reverse correlation with all clinicopathological parameters, including TNM stage, disease relapse, Gleason score, disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval. In addition, the expression levels of these three genes were strongly correlated with anti-cancer immune cell filtration in primary prostate cancers. In a group of patients with early-onset prostate cancers, SLC2A4 also showed a strong negative correlation with multiple clinicopathological parameters, such as tumor mutation burden, biochemical relapse, pre-surgical PSA levels, and Gleason score but a positive correlation with progression-free interval after surgery. In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC), SLC2A9 gene expression but not SLC2A4 or SLC2A5 genes showed a significant correlation with androgen receptor (AR) activity score and neuroendocrinal (NE) activity score. Meanwhile, SLC2A2/9/13 expression was significantly elevated in CRPC tumors with neuroendocrinal features compared to those without NE features. On the other hand, SLC2A10 and SlC2A12 gene expression were significantly reduced in NEPC tumors compared to CRPC tumors. Consistently, SLC2A10/12 expression levels were significantly reduced in castrated animals carrying the LuCaP35 xenograft models. Survival outcome analysis revealed that SLC2A4 expression in primary tumors is a favorable prognostic factor and SLC2A6 is a worse prognostic factor for disease-specific survival and progression-free survival in prostate cancer patients. In conclusion, our results suggest that SLC2A4/6 expressions are strong prognostic factors for prostate cancer progression and survival. The significance of SLC2A2/9/13 over-expression during NEPC progression needs more investigation.\n",

      "Sorting nexins (SNXs) or phox homology (PX) domain containing proteins are central regulators of cell trafficking and signaling. A subfamily of PX domain proteins possesses two unique PX-associated domains, as well as a regulator of G protein-coupled receptor signaling (RGS) domain that attenuates Gαs-coupled G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Here we delineate the structural organization of these RGS-PX proteins, revealing a protein family with a modular architecture that is conserved in all eukaryotes. The one exception to this is mammalian SNX19, which lacks the typical RGS structure but preserves all other domains. The PX domain is a sensor of membrane phosphoinositide lipids and we find that specific sequence alterations in the PX domains of the mammalian RGS-PX proteins, SNX13, SNX14, SNX19, and SNX25, confer differential phosphoinositide binding preferences. Although SNX13 and SNX19 PX domains bind the early endosomal lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, SNX14 shows no membrane binding at all. Crystal structures of the SNX19 and SNX14 PX domains reveal key differences, with alterations in SNX14 leading to closure of the binding pocket to prevent phosphoinositide association. Our findings suggest a role for alternative membrane interactions in spatial control of RGS-PX proteins in cell signaling and trafficking.\n",

      "As a subgroup of sorting nexins (SNXs) that contain regulator of G protein signaling homology (RH) domain, SNX-RH proteins, including SNX13, SNX14 and SNX25, were proposed to play bifunctional roles in protein sorting and GPCR signaling regulation. However, mechanistic details of SNX-RH proteins functioning via RH domain remain to be illustrated. Here, we delineate crystal structures of the RH domains of SNX13 and SNX25, revealing a homodimer of SNX13 RH domain mediated by unique extended α4 and α5 helices, and a thiol modulated homodimer of SNX25-RH triggered by a unique cysteine on α6 helix. Further studies showed that RH domains of SNX-RH do not possess binding capacity toward Gα subunits, owing to the lack of critical residues for interaction. Thus, this study identifies a group of novel non-canonical RH domains that can act as a dimerization module in sorting nexins, which provides structural basis for mechanism studies on SNX-RH protein functions.\n",

      "Intracellular transport is vital for the function, survival and architecture of every eukaryotic cell. Long-range transport in animal cells is thought to depend exclusively on microtubule tracks. This study reveals an unexpected actin-dependent but microtubule-independent mechanism for long-range transport of vesicles. Vesicles organize their own actin tracks by recruiting the actin nucleation factors Spire1, Spire2 and Formin-2, which assemble an extensive actin network from the vesicles' surfaces. The network connects the vesicles with one another and with the plasma membrane. Vesicles move directionally along these connections in a myosin-Vb-dependent manner to converge and to reach the cell surface. The overall outward-directed movement of the vesicle-actin network is driven by recruitment of vesicles to the plasma membrane in the periphery of the oocyte. Being organized in a dynamic vesicle-actin network allows vesicles to move in a local random manner and a global directed manner at the same time: they can reach any position in the cytoplasm, but also move directionally to the cell surface as a collective. Thus, collective movement within a network is a powerful and flexible mode of vesicle transport.\n",

      "Looking back at two decades of research on SPIRE actin nucleator proteins, the first decade was clearly dominated by the discovery of SPIRE proteins as founding members of the novel WH2-domain-based actin nucleators, which initiate actin filament assembly through multiple WH2 actin-binding domains. Through complex formation with formins and class 5 myosins, SPIRE proteins coordinate actin filament assembly and myosin motor-dependent force generation. The discovery of SPIRE-regulated cytoplasmic actin filament meshworks in oocytes initiated the next phase of SPIRE research, which has found that SPIRE proteins are integrated in a diverse range of cell biological processes. In addition to regulating vesicle-based actin filament meshworks, SPIRE proteins function in the organisation of actin structures driving the inward movement of pronuclei of the mouse zygote. Localisation at cortical ring structures and the results of knockdown experiments indicate that SPIRE proteins function in the formation of meiotic cleavage sites in mammalian oocytes and the externalisation of von Willebrand factor from endothelial cells. Alternative splicing targets mammalian SPIRE1 towards mitochondria, where it has a role in fission. In this Review, we summarise the past two decades of SPIRE research by addressing the biochemical and cell biological functions of SPIRE proteins in mammalian reproduction, skin pigmentation and wound healing, as well as in mitochondrial dynamics and host-pathogen interactions.\n",

      "The DNA damage response (DDR) is essential for maintaining genome integrity. Mounting evidence reveals that protein modifications play vital roles in the DDR. Here, we show that USP38 is involved in the DDR by regulating the activity of HDAC1. In response to DNA damage, USP38 interacted with HDAC1 and specifically removed the K63-linked ubiquitin chain promoting the deacetylase activity of HDAC1. As a result, HDAC1 was able to deacetylate H3K56. USP38 deletion resulted in persistent focal accumulation of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) factors at DNA damage sites and impaired NHEJ efficiency, causing genome instability and sensitizing cancer cells to genotoxic insults. Knockout of USP38 rendered mice hypersensitive to irradiation and shortened survival. In addition, USP38 was expressed at low levels in certain types of cancers including renal cell carcinoma, indicating dysregulation of USP38 expression contributes to genomic instability and may lead to tumorigenesis. In summary, this study identifies a critical role of USP38 in modulating genome integrity and cancer cell resistance to genotoxic insults by deubiquitinating HDAC1 and regulating its deacetylation activity. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that USP38 regulates genome stability and mediates cancer cell resistance to DNA-damaging therapy, providing insight into tumorigenesis and implicating USP38 as a potential target for cancer diagnosis.\n",

      "Th2 immune response is critical for allergic asthma pathogenesis. Molecular mechanisms for regulating Th2 immunity are still not well understood. Here we report that the ubiquitin-specific protease USP38 is crucial for Th2-mediated allergic asthma. TCR stimulation up-regulated the USP38 level, and USP38 in turn mediated the protein stabilization of JunB, a transcription factor specific for Th2 development. Consequently, USP38 was specifically required for TCR-induced production of Th2 cytokines and Th2 development both in vitro and in vivo, and USP38-deficient mice were resistant to asthma pathogenesis induced by OVA or HDM. Mechanistically, USP38 directly associated with JunB, deubiquitinated Lys-48-linked poly-ubiquitination of JunB, and consequently blocked TCR-induced JunB turnover. USP38 represents the first identified deubiquitinase specifically for Th2 immunity and the associated asthma.\n",

      "N-degron pathways are a set of proteolytic systems that target the N-terminal destabilizing residues of substrates for proteasomal degradation. Recently, the Gly/N-degron pathway has been identified as a new branch of the N-degron pathway. The N-terminal glycine degron (Gly/N-degron) is recognized by ZYG11B and ZER1, the substrate receptors of the Cullin 2-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL2). Here we present the crystal structures of ZYG11B and ZER1 bound to various Gly/N-degrons. The structures reveal that ZYG11B and ZER1 utilize their armadillo (ARM) repeats forming a deep and narrow cavity to engage mainly the first four residues of Gly/N-degrons. The α-amino group of the Gly/N-degron is accommodated in an acidic pocket by five conserved hydrogen bonds. These structures, together with biochemical studies, decipher the molecular basis for the specific recognition of the Gly/N-degron by ZYG11B and ZER1, providing key information for future structure-based chemical probe design.\n",

      "High amylase activity in dogs is associated with a drastic increase in copy numbers of the gene coding for pancreatic amylase, AMY2B, that likely allowed dogs to thrive on a relatively starch-rich diet during early dog domestication. Although most dogs thus probably digest starch more efficiently than do wolves, AMY2B copy numbers vary widely within the dog population, and it is not clear how this variation affects the individual ability to handle starch nor how it affects dog health. In humans, copy numbers of the gene coding for salivary amylase, AMY1, correlate with both salivary amylase levels and enzyme activity, and high amylase activity is related to improved glycemic homeostasis and lower frequencies of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigate the relationship between AMY2B copy numbers and serum amylase activity in dogs and show that amylase activity correlates with AMY2B copy numbers. We then describe how AMY2B copy numbers vary in individuals from 20 dog breeds and find strong breed-dependent patterns, indicating that the ability to digest starch varies both at the breed and individual level. Finally, to test whether AMY2B copy number is strongly associated with the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, we compare copy numbers in cases and controls as well as in breeds with varying diabetes susceptibility. Although we see no such association here, future studies using larger cohorts are needed before excluding a possible link between AMY2B and diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent, and physical exercise represents one of the most effective methods to attenuate NAFLD. However, the mechanism of aerobic exercise improving NAFLD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on CNPY2-PERK pathway in mice with NAFLD. Our study found that a high-fat diet induced NAFLD, causing an abnormal lipid metabolism and liver function injury, and increased the expressions of CNPY2, CNPY2 mRNA, PERK, PERK mRNA, p-eIF2a and CHOP. However, aerobic exercise reversesd all these parameters. These data suggest that CNPY2-PERK pathway is involved in the formation of NAFLD, and aerobic exercise can effectively improve NAFLD, which may be related to down-regulate the protein expressions of the CNPY2-PERK pathway.\n",

      "EGFL7 is a secreted angiogenic factor that is highly conserved in vertebrates. Most secreted angiogenic signaling molecules, including VEGF and fibroblast growth factor-2, are mainly expressed by non-endothelial cell types such as fibroblasts. In contrast, EGFL7 is unique because it is almost exclusively expressed by and acts on endothelial cells. Egfl7 expression is highest when the endothelium is in an active, proliferating state. This factor acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and binds to components of the extracellular matrix. In vivo, Egfl7 is important for regulating tubulogenesis in zebrafish and for controlling vascular patterning and integrity in mice. Its function in blood vessel development is mediated, at least in part, through modulation of Notch signaling. In this review, we summarize the findings that support a role for Egfl7 in developmental and postnatal angiogenesis and describe the EGFL7-signaling pathways that underlie these processes. In addition, we discuss a potential role for EGFL7 in vascular repair and its possible use as a therapeutic target for treatment of hypoxia-induced injury. Finally, we consider EGFL7 action during tumorigenesis and its potential as an antiangiogenic agent.\n",

      "Epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein 7 (EGFL7), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family, is a potent angiogenic factor expressed in many different cell types. EGFL7 plays a vital role in controlling vascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the main signaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulating evidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has been frequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma, colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression of miR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role in oncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in both the osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activities via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of its angiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, such as ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.\n",

      "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis and permeability should enable the development of more effective therapies for various diseases, including retinopathy, cancer, and other vascular disorders. We focused on epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) which plays an important role in NOTCH signaling and in the organization of angiogenic sprouts. We developed an EGFL7-knockdown in vitro microvessel model and investigated the effect of EGFL7 at a tissue level. We found EGFL7 knockdown suppressed VEGF-A-induced sprouting angiogenesis accompanied by an overproduction of endothelial filopodia and reduced collagen IV deposition at the basal side of endothelial cells. We also observed impaired barrier function which reflected an inflammatory condition. Furthermore, our results showed that proper formation of adherens junctions and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was disturbed. In conclusion, by using a 3D microvessel model we identified novel roles for EGFL7 in endothelial function during sprouting angiogenesis.\n",

      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "The angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4 and 8 have emerged as key regulators of plasma lipid metabolism by serving as potent inhibitors of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In this review, we provide an integrated picture of the role of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 in lipid metabolism by focusing on their impact on LPL activity and plasma triglyceride clearance during physiological conditions such as fasting, refeeding, exercise and cold exposure.\n",
      "Upon refeeding, circulating ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 promote the replenishment of white adipose tissue depots by specifically inhibiting LPL activity in oxidative tissues. During exercise and cold exposure, ANGPTL4 represses local LPL activity to assure that plasma triglycerides are specifically shuttled to exercising muscle and brown adipose tissue, respectively. Overall, ANGPTL4 is the central component of a fatty acid-driven feedback mechanism that regulates plasma triglyceride hydrolysis and subsequent tissue fatty acid uptake in response to changes in lipid availability and cellular fuel demand.\n",
      "ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 together ensure that triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are adequately distributed during different physiological conditions. The impact of the ANGPTLs on plasma lipid levels has led to scrutiny of ANGPTLs as therapeutic targets for dyslipidemia.\n",

      "Microglia, once viewed as static bystanders with limited homeostatic functions, are now considered key players in the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial activation is a salient feature of neuroinflammation involving a dynamic process that generates multitudinous microglial phenotypes that can respond to a variety of situational cues in the central nervous system. Recently, a flurry of single cell RNA-sequencing studies have defined microglial phenotypes in unprecedented detail, and have highlighted robust changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Increased expression of genes such as Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) in microglia during development, damage, and disease, suggest that increased lipid metabolism is needed to fuel protective cellular functions such as phagocytosis. This review describes our current understanding of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in microglia, and highlights microglial lipid metabolism as a modifiable target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "A major step in energy metabolism is hydrolysis of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) to release fatty acids that can be used or stored. This is accomplished by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at 'binding lipolysis sites' at the vascular endothelium. A multitude of interactions are involved in this seemingly simple reaction. Recent advances in the understanding of some of these factors will be discussed in an attempt to build a comprehensive picture.\n",
      "The first event in catabolism of TRLs is that they dock at the vascular endothelium. This requires LPL and GPIHBP1, the endothelial transporter of LPL.Kinetic studies in rats with labeled chylomicrons showed that once a chylomicron has docked in the heart it stays for minutes and a large number of triacylglycerol molecules are split. The distribution of binding between tissues reflects the amount of LPL, as evident from studies with mutant mice.Clearance of TRLs is often slowed down in metabolic disease, as was demonstrated both in mice and men. In mice, this was directly connected to decreased amounts of endothelial LPL.\n",
      "The LPL system is central in energy metabolism and results from interplay between several factors. Rapid and exciting progress is being made.\n",

      "The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is the founding member of a family of seven structurally closely related transmembrane proteins (LRP1, LRP1b, megalin/LRP2, LDL receptor, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, MEGF7/LRP4, LRP8/apolipoprotein E receptor2). These proteins participate in a wide range of physiological processes, including the regulation of lipid metabolism, protection against atherosclerosis, neurodevelopment, and transport of nutrients and vitamins. While currently available data suggest that the role of the LDL receptor is limited to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles, there is growing experimental evidence that the other members of the gene family have additional physiological functions as signal transducers. In this review, we focus on the latest discovered functions of two major members of this family, LRP1 and megalin/LRP2, and on the newly elucidated physiological role of a third member of the family, MEGF7/LRP4, which can also function as a modulator of diverse signaling pathways during development.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized with progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature that occurs prior to neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction. Mounting evidence suggests that aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau leads to synaptic deficits and neurodegeneration, thereby to memory loss. Among the established genetic risk factors for AD, the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor. We and others previously demonstrated that apoE regulates Aβ aggregation and clearance in an isoform-dependent manner. While the effect of apoE on Aβ may explain how apoE isoforms differentially affect AD pathogenesis, there are also other underexplored pathogenic mechanisms. They include differential effects of apoE on cerebral energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, neurovascular function, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. ApoE is a major carrier of cholesterols that are required for neuronal activity and injury repair in the brain. Although there are a few conflicting findings and the underlying mechanism is still unclear, several lines of studies demonstrated that apoE4 leads to synaptic deficits and impairment in long-term potentiation, memory and cognition. In this review, we summarize current understanding of apoE function in the brain, with a particular emphasis on its role in synaptic plasticity and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, involving low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), syndecan, and LRP8/ApoER2.\n",

      "The LDL receptor gene family constitutes a class of structurally closely related cell surface receptors fulfilling diverse functions in different organs, tissues, and cell types. The LDL receptor is the prototype of this family, which also includes the VLDLR, ApoER2/LRP8, LRP1 and LRP1B, as well as Megalin/GP330, SorLA/LR11, LRP5, LRP6 and MEGF7. Recently several lines of evidence have positioned the LDL receptor gene family as one of the key players in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Initially this receptor family was of high interest due to its key function in cholesterol/apolipoprotein E (ApoE) uptake, with the epsilon4 allele of ApoE as the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. It has been established that the cholesterol metabolism of the cell has a strong impact on the production of Abeta, the major component of the plaques found in the brain of AD-patients. The original report that soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing the kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain might act as a ligand for LRP1 led to a complex investigation of the interaction of both proteins and their potential function in AD development. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that LRP1 might bind to APP independent of the KPI domain in APP. This APP - LRP1 interaction is facilitated through a trimeric complex of APP-FE65-LRP1, which has a functional role in APP processing. Along with LRP1, APP is transported from the early secretory compartments to the cell surface and subsequently internalised into the endosomal / lysosomal compartments. Recent investigations indicate that ApoER2 and SorLA fulfil a similar role in shifting APP localisation in the cell, which affects APP processing and the production of the APP derived amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). In addition to the effect of lipoprotein receptors on APP processing and Abeta production, LRP1 has been shown to bind Abeta directly or indirectly through Abeta-lactoferrin, Abeta-alpha2M and Abeta-ApoE complexes in vitro and in vivo. Based on these observations two LRP1 mediated clearance mechanisms of Abeta are proposed to play a crucial role in the prevention of AD: either Abeta-uptake into a cell with its subsequent degradation or its transport out of the brain over the blood brain barrier into the periphery. Following this export Abeta is degraded in the liver, where LRP1 potentially conducts the removal of Abeta from the blood stream. Although the involvement of LDLR family members in AD is not yet fully understood it becomes clear that they can directly affect APP production, Abeta-clearance and Abeta-transport over the blood brain barrier.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) binds to LDL receptor (LDLR) and targets it for lysosomal degradation in cells. Decreased hepatic clearance of plasma LDL-cholesterol is the primary gauge of PCSK9 activity in humans; however, PCSK9's evolutionary role may extend to other lipoprotein classes and processes. This review highlights studies that are providing novel insights into physiological regulation of PCSK9 transcription and plasma PCSK9 activity.\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that circulating PCSK9 binds to apolipoprotein B100 on LDL particles, which in turn inhibits PCSK9's ability to bind to cell surface LDLRs. Negative feedback of secreted PCSK9 activity by LDL could serve to increase plasma excursion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and monitor lipoprotein remodeling. Recent findings have identified hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α as a key transcriptional regulator that cooperates with sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 to control PCSK9 expression in hepatocytes in response to nutritional and hormonal inputs, as well as acute inflammation.\n",
      "PCSK9 is an established target for cholesterol-lowering therapies. Further study of PCSK9 regulatory mechanisms may identify additional control points for pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. PCSK9 function could reflect ancient roles in the fasting-feeding cycle and in linking lipoprotein metabolism with innate immunity.\n",

      "The SREBP2/LDLR pathway is sensitive to cholesterol content in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while membrane low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is influenced by sterol response element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL). LDL-C, one of the risk factors in cardiovascular disease, is cleared through endocytosis recycling of LDLR. Therefore, we propose that a balance between LDLR endocytosis recycling and PCSK9-mediated and IDOL-mediated lysosomal LDLR degradation is responsible for cholesterol homeostasis in the ER. For statins that decrease serum LDL-C levels via cholesterol synthesis inhibition, the mechanism by which the statins increase the membrane LDLR may be regulated by cholesterol homeostasis in the ER.\n",

      "Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting diet-induced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b(+/+) and Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, PPAR-delta, PPAR-gamma, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Excessive absorption of products of dietary fat digestion leads to type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related disorders. Mice deficient in the group 1B phospholipase A₂ (Pla2g1b), a gut digestive enzyme, are protected against diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes without displaying dietary lipid malabsorption. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Pla2g1b protects against diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Results showed that the Pla2g1b(-/-) mice had decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice subsequent to feeding a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (hypercaloric) diet. These differences were evident before differences in body weight gains were observed. Injection of Poloxamer 407 to inhibit lipolysis revealed decreased VLDL production in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. Supplementation with lysophosphatidylcholine, the product of Pla2g1b hydrolysis, restored VLDL production rates in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice and further elevated VLDL production in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed decreased postprandial lipidemia compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. These results show that, in addition to dietary fatty acids, gut-derived lysophospholipids derived from Pla2g1b hydrolysis of dietary and biliary phospholipids also promote hepatic VLDL production. Thus, the inhibition of lysophospholipid absorption via Pla2g1b inactivation may prove beneficial against diet-induced hyperlipidemia in addition to the protection against obesity and diabetes.\n",

      "Immunity to intestinal helminth infections has been well studied, but the mechanism of helminth killing prior to expulsion remains unclear. Here we identify epithelial-cell-derived phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> group 1B (PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B) as a host-derived endogenous anthelmintic. PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B is elevated in resistant mice and is responsible for killing tissue-embedded larvae. Despite comparable activities of other essential type-2-dependent immune mechanisms, Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to expel the intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Expression of Pla2g1b by epithelial cells was dependent upon intestinal microbiota, adaptive immunity, and common-gamma chain-dependent signaling. Notably, Pla2g1b was downregulated in susceptible mice and inhibited by IL-4R-signaling in vitro, uncoupling parasite killing from expulsion mechanisms. Resistance was restored in Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice by treating infective H. polygyrus L3 larvae with PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B, which reduced larval phospholipid abundance. These findings uncover epithelial-cell-derived Pla2g1b as an essential mediator of helminth killing, highlighting a previously overlooked mechanism of anti-helminth immunity.\n",

      "Reelin is a glycoprotein that serves important roles both during development (regulation of neuronal migration and brain lamination) and in adulthood (maintenance of synaptic function). A number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Alzheimer's disease and lissencephaly share a common feature of abnormal Reelin expression in the brain. Altered Reelin expression has been hypothesized to impair neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity, leading ultimately to the cognitive deficits present in these disorders. The mechanisms for abnormal Reelin expression in some of these disorders are currently unknown although possible explanations include early developmental insults, mutations, hypermethylation of the promoter for the Reelin gene (RELN), miRNA silencing of Reelin mRNA, FMRP underexpression and Reelin processing abnormalities. Increasing Reelin expression through pharmacological therapies may help ameliorate symptoms resulting from Reelin deficits.

      "Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a major cause of developmental disabilities, severe epilepsy, and reproductive disadvantage. Genes that have been associated to MCD are mainly involved in cell proliferation and specification, neuronal migration, and late cortical organization. Lissencephaly-pachygyria-severe band heterotopia are diffuse neuronal migration disorders causing severe global neurological impairment. Abnormalities of the <i>LIS1, DCX, ARX</i>, <i>RELN</i>, <i>VLDLR</i>, <i>ACTB</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>TUBG1</i>, <i>KIF5C</i>, <i>KIF2A</i>, and <i>CDK5</i> genes have been associated with these malformations. More recent studies have also established a relationship between lissencephaly, with or without associated microcephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis as well as cerebellar hypoplasia, and at times, a morphological pattern consistent with polymicrogyria with mutations of several genes <i>(TUBA1A</i>, <i>TUBA8</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, <i>TUBB2B</i>, <i>TUBB3</i>, and <i>DYNC1H1)</i>, regulating the synthesis and function of microtubule and centrosome key components and hence defined as tubulinopathies. MCD only affecting subsets of neurons, such as mild subcortical band heterotopia and periventricular heterotopia, have been associated with abnormalities of the <i>DCX</i>, <i>FLN1A</i>, and <i>ARFGEF2</i> genes and cause neurological and cognitive impairment that vary from severe to mild deficits. Polymicrogyria results from abnormal late cortical organization and is inconstantly associated with abnormal neuronal migration. Localized polymicrogyria has been associated with anatomo-specific deficits, including disorders of language and higher cognition. Polymicrogyria is genetically heterogeneous, and only in a small minority of patients, a definite genetic cause has been identified. Megalencephaly with normal cortex or polymicrogyria by MRI imaging, hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia can all result from mutations in genes of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Postzygotic mutations have been described for most MCD and can be limited to the dysplastic tissue in the less diffuse forms.\n",

      "Proper neuronal migration and laminar formation during corticogenesis is essential for normal brain function. Disruption of these developmental processes is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of some neuropsychiatric conditions. Especially, Reelin, a glycoprotein mainly secreted by the Cajal-Retzius cells and a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons, has been shown to play a critical role, both during embryonic and postnatal periods. Indeed, animal studies have clearly revealed that Reelin is an essential molecule for proper migration of cortical neurons and finally regulates the cell positioning in the cortex during embryonic and early postnatal stages; by contrast, Reelin signaling is closely involved in synaptic function in adulthood. In humans, genetic studies have shown that the <i>reelin</i> gene (<i>RELN</i>) is associated with a number of psychiatric diseases, including Schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BP) and autistic spectrum disorder. Indeed, <i>Reln</i> haploinsufficiency has been shown to cause cognitive impairment in rodents, suggesting the expression level of the Reelin protein is closely related to the higher brain functions. However, the molecular abnormalities in the Reelin pathway involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders are not yet fully understood. In this article, we review the current progress in the understanding of the Reelin functions that could be related to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, we discuss the basis for selecting Reelin and molecules in its downstream signaling pathway as potential therapeutic targets for psychiatric illnesses.\n",

      "We review the genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their role in AD pathogenesis. More recent advances in understanding of the human genome-technologic advances in methods to analyze millions of polymorphisms in thousands of subjects-have revealed new genes associated with AD risk, including ABCA7, BIN1, CASS4, CD33, CD2AP, CELF1, CLU, CR1, DSG2, EPHA1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5-DBR1, INPP5D, MS4A, MEF2C, NME8, PICALM, PTK2B, SLC24H4-RIN3, SORL1, and ZCWPW1. Emerging technologies to analyze the entire genome in large data sets have also revealed coding variants that increase AD risk: PLD3 and TREM2. We review the relationship between these AD risk genes and the cellular and neuropathologic features of AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, classified as either early onset (under 65 years of age), or late onset (over 65 years of age). Three main genes are involved in early onset AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele has been found to be a main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes that might be potential risk factors for AD, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Recent studies have discovered additional novel genes that might be involved in late-onset AD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). Identification of new AD-related genes is important for better understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Since the differential diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders are difficult, especially in the early stages, genetic testing is essential for diagnostic processes. Next-generation sequencing studies have been successfully used for detecting mutations, monitoring the epigenetic changes, and analyzing transcriptomes. These studies may be a promising approach toward understanding the complete genetic mechanisms of diverse genetic disorders such as AD.\n",

      "Whether cholesterol is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still controversial. Several studies that explored the association between lipids and/or lipid-lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ, CLU), ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7(ABCA7), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Functional cell biology studies further support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of Aβ precursor protein processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase resulting in altered Aβ production. However, conflicting evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk, randomized clinical trials observing no beneficial effect of statin therapy, and cell biology studies suggesting that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol level is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits colocalization of β-secretase 1 and Aβ precursor protein in nonraft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an Aβ-degrading enzyme. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the findings of epidemiological, genetic, and cell biology studies aiming to elucidate the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "Reelin is a large secreted glycoprotein that is essential for correct neuronal positioning during neurodevelopment and is important for synaptic plasticity in the mature brain. Moreover, Reelin is expressed in many extraneuronal tissues; yet the roles of peripheral Reelin are largely unknown. In the brain, many of Reelin's functions are mediated by a molecular signaling cascade that involves two lipoprotein receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (Apoer2) and very low density-lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr), the neuronal phosphoprotein Disabled-1 (Dab1), and members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases as crucial elements. This core signaling pathway in turn modulates the activity of adaptor proteins and downstream protein kinase cascades, many of which target the neuronal cytoskeleton. However, additional Reelin-binding receptors have been postulated or described, either as coreceptors that are essential for the activation of the \"canonical\" Reelin signaling cascade involving Apoer2/Vldlr and Dab1, or as receptors that activate alternative or additional signaling pathways. Here we will give an overview of canonical and alternative Reelin signaling pathways, molecular mechanisms involved, and their potential physiological roles in the context of different biological settings.\n",

This review focuses on Apoer2 and Vldlr signaling in the CNS and its role in human disease.\n",

      "High amylase activity in dogs is associated with a drastic increase in copy numbers of the gene coding for pancreatic amylase, AMY2B, that likely allowed dogs to thrive on a relatively starch-rich diet during early dog domestication. Although most dogs thus probably digest starch more efficiently than do wolves, AMY2B copy numbers vary widely within the dog population, and it is not clear how this variation affects the individual ability to handle starch nor how it affects dog health. In humans, copy numbers of the gene coding for salivary amylase, AMY1, correlate with both salivary amylase levels and enzyme activity, and high amylase activity is related to improved glycemic homeostasis and lower frequencies of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigate the relationship between AMY2B copy numbers and serum amylase activity in dogs and show that amylase activity correlates with AMY2B copy numbers. We then describe how AMY2B copy numbers vary in individuals from 20 dog breeds and find strong breed-dependent patterns, indicating that the ability to digest starch varies both at the breed and individual level. Finally, to test whether AMY2B copy number is strongly associated with the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, we compare copy numbers in cases and controls as well as in breeds with varying diabetes susceptibility. Although we see no such association here, future studies using larger cohorts are needed before excluding a possible link between AMY2B and diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Prolonged human interactions and artificial selection have influenced the genotypic and phenotypic diversity among dog breeds. Because humans and dogs occupy diverse habitats, ecological contexts have likely contributed to breed-specific positive selection. Prior to the advent of modern dog-feeding practices, there was likely substantial variation in dietary landscapes among disparate dog breeds. As such, we investigated one type of genetic variant, copy number variation, in three metabolic genes: glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), phytanol-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH), and pancreatic α-amylase 2B (AMY2B). These genes code for proteins that are responsible for metabolizing dietary products that originate from distinctly different food types: sugar, meat, and starch, respectively. After surveying copy number variation among dogs with diverse dietary histories, we found no correlation between diet and positive selection in either GCKR or PHYH. Although it has been previously demonstrated that dogs experienced a copy number increase in AMY2B relative to wolves during or after the dog domestication process, we demonstrate that positive selection continued to act on amylase copy number in dog breeds that consumed starch-rich diets in time periods after domestication. Furthermore, we found that introgression with wolves is not responsible for deterioration of positive selection on AMY2B among diverse dog breeds. Together, this supports the hypothesis that the amylase copy number expansion is found universally in dogs.\n",

      "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent, and physical exercise represents one of the most effective methods to attenuate NAFLD. However, the mechanism of aerobic exercise improving NAFLD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on CNPY2-PERK pathway in mice with NAFLD. Our study found that a high-fat diet induced NAFLD, causing an abnormal lipid metabolism and liver function injury, and increased the expressions of CNPY2, CNPY2 mRNA, PERK, PERK mRNA, p-eIF2a and CHOP. However, aerobic exercise reversesd all these parameters. These data suggest that CNPY2-PERK pathway is involved in the formation of NAFLD, and aerobic exercise can effectively improve NAFLD, which may be related to down-regulate the protein expressions of the CNPY2-PERK pathway.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "EGFL7 is a secreted angiogenic factor that is highly conserved in vertebrates. Most secreted angiogenic signaling molecules, including VEGF and fibroblast growth factor-2, are mainly expressed by non-endothelial cell types such as fibroblasts. In contrast, EGFL7 is unique because it is almost exclusively expressed by and acts on endothelial cells. Egfl7 expression is highest when the endothelium is in an active, proliferating state. This factor acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and binds to components of the extracellular matrix. In vivo, Egfl7 is important for regulating tubulogenesis in zebrafish and for controlling vascular patterning and integrity in mice. Its function in blood vessel development is mediated, at least in part, through modulation of Notch signaling. In this review, we summarize the findings that support a role for Egfl7 in developmental and postnatal angiogenesis and describe the EGFL7-signaling pathways that underlie these processes. In addition, we discuss a potential role for EGFL7 in vascular repair and its possible use as a therapeutic target for treatment of hypoxia-induced injury. Finally, we consider EGFL7 action during tumorigenesis and its potential as an antiangiogenic agent.\n",

      "Epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein 7 (EGFL7), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family, is a potent angiogenic factor expressed in many different cell types. EGFL7 plays a vital role in controlling vascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the main signaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulating evidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has been frequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma, colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression of miR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role in oncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in both the osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activities via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of its angiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, such as ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.\n",

      "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis and permeability should enable the development of more effective therapies for various diseases, including retinopathy, cancer, and other vascular disorders. We focused on epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) which plays an important role in NOTCH signaling and in the organization of angiogenic sprouts. We developed an EGFL7-knockdown in vitro microvessel model and investigated the effect of EGFL7 at a tissue level. We found EGFL7 knockdown suppressed VEGF-A-induced sprouting angiogenesis accompanied by an overproduction of endothelial filopodia and reduced collagen IV deposition at the basal side of endothelial cells. We also observed impaired barrier function which reflected an inflammatory condition. Furthermore, our results showed that proper formation of adherens junctions and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was disturbed. In conclusion, by using a 3D microvessel model we identified novel roles for EGFL7 in endothelial function during sprouting angiogenesis.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "It is now about 20 years since the first case of a gain-of-function mutation involving the as-yet-unknown actor in cholesterol homeostasis, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), was described. It was soon clear that this protein would have been of huge scientific and clinical value as a therapeutic strategy for dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) management. Indeed, PCSK9 is a serine protease belonging to the proprotein convertase family, mainly produced by the liver, and essential for metabolism of LDL particles by inhibiting LDL receptor (LDLR) recirculation to the cell surface with the consequent upregulation of LDLR-dependent LDL-C levels. Beyond its effects on LDL metabolism, several studies revealed the existence of additional roles of PCSK9 in different stages of atherosclerosis, also for its ability to target other members of the LDLR family. PCSK9 from plasma and vascular cells can contribute to the development of atherosclerotic plaque and thrombosis by promoting platelet activation, leukocyte recruitment and clot formation, also through mechanisms not related to systemic lipid changes. These results further supported the value for the potential cardiovascular benefits of therapies based on PCSK9 inhibition. Actually, the passive immunization with anti-PCSK9 antibodies, evolocumab and alirocumab, is shown to be effective in dramatically reducing the LDL-C levels and attenuating CVD. While monoclonal antibodies sequester circulating PCSK9, inclisiran, a small interfering RNA, is a new drug that inhibits PCSK9 synthesis with the important advantage, compared with PCSK9 mAbs, to preserve its pharmacodynamic effects when administrated every 6 months. Here, we will focus on the major understandings related to PCSK9, from its discovery to its role in lipoprotein metabolism, involvement in atherothrombosis and a brief excursus on approved current therapies used to inhibit its action.\n",

      "The angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4 and 8 have emerged as key regulators of plasma lipid metabolism by serving as potent inhibitors of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In this review, we provide an integrated picture of the role of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 in lipid metabolism by focusing on their impact on LPL activity and plasma triglyceride clearance during physiological conditions such as fasting, refeeding, exercise and cold exposure.\n",
      "Upon refeeding, circulating ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 promote the replenishment of white adipose tissue depots by specifically inhibiting LPL activity in oxidative tissues. During exercise and cold exposure, ANGPTL4 represses local LPL activity to assure that plasma triglycerides are specifically shuttled to exercising muscle and brown adipose tissue, respectively. Overall, ANGPTL4 is the central component of a fatty acid-driven feedback mechanism that regulates plasma triglyceride hydrolysis and subsequent tissue fatty acid uptake in response to changes in lipid availability and cellular fuel demand.\n",
      "ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 together ensure that triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are adequately distributed during different physiological conditions. The impact of the ANGPTLs on plasma lipid levels has led to scrutiny of ANGPTLs as therapeutic targets for dyslipidemia.\n",

      "Microglia, once viewed as static bystanders with limited homeostatic functions, are now considered key players in the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial activation is a salient feature of neuroinflammation involving a dynamic process that generates multitudinous microglial phenotypes that can respond to a variety of situational cues in the central nervous system. Recently, a flurry of single cell RNA-sequencing studies have defined microglial phenotypes in unprecedented detail, and have highlighted robust changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Increased expression of genes such as Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) in microglia during development, damage, and disease, suggest that increased lipid metabolism is needed to fuel protective cellular functions such as phagocytosis. This review describes our current understanding of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in microglia, and highlights microglial lipid metabolism as a modifiable target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "A major step in energy metabolism is hydrolysis of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) to release fatty acids that can be used or stored. This is accomplished by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at 'binding lipolysis sites' at the vascular endothelium. A multitude of interactions are involved in this seemingly simple reaction. Recent advances in the understanding of some of these factors will be discussed in an attempt to build a comprehensive picture.\n",
      "The first event in catabolism of TRLs is that they dock at the vascular endothelium. This requires LPL and GPIHBP1, the endothelial transporter of LPL.Kinetic studies in rats with labeled chylomicrons showed that once a chylomicron has docked in the heart it stays for minutes and a large number of triacylglycerol molecules are split. The distribution of binding between tissues reflects the amount of LPL, as evident from studies with mutant mice.Clearance of TRLs is often slowed down in metabolic disease, as was demonstrated both in mice and men. In mice, this was directly connected to decreased amounts of endothelial LPL.\n",

      "The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is the founding member of a family of seven structurally closely related transmembrane proteins (LRP1, LRP1b, megalin/LRP2, LDL receptor, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, MEGF7/LRP4, LRP8/apolipoprotein E receptor2). These proteins participate in a wide range of physiological processes, including the regulation of lipid metabolism, protection against atherosclerosis, neurodevelopment, and transport of nutrients and vitamins. While currently available data suggest that the role of the LDL receptor is limited to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles, there is growing experimental evidence that the other members of the gene family have additional physiological functions as signal transducers. In this review, we focus on the latest discovered functions of two major members of this family, LRP1 and megalin/LRP2, and on the newly elucidated physiological role of a third member of the family, MEGF7/LRP4, which can also function as a modulator of diverse signaling pathways during development.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized with progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature that occurs prior to neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction. Mounting evidence suggests that aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau leads to synaptic deficits and neurodegeneration, thereby to memory loss. Among the established genetic risk factors for AD, the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor. We and others previously demonstrated that apoE regulates Aβ aggregation and clearance in an isoform-dependent manner. While the effect of apoE on Aβ may explain how apoE isoforms differentially affect AD pathogenesis, there are also other underexplored pathogenic mechanisms. They include differential effects of apoE on cerebral energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, neurovascular function, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. ApoE is a major carrier of cholesterols that are required for neuronal activity and injury repair in the brain. Although there are a few conflicting findings and the underlying mechanism is still unclear, several lines of studies demonstrated that apoE4 leads to synaptic deficits and impairment in long-term potentiation, memory and cognition. In this review, we summarize current understanding of apoE function in the brain, with a particular emphasis on its role in synaptic plasticity and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, involving low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), syndecan, and LRP8/ApoER2.\n",

      "The LDL receptor gene family constitutes a class of structurally closely related cell surface receptors fulfilling diverse functions in different organs, tissues, and cell types. The LDL receptor is the prototype of this family, which also includes the VLDLR, ApoER2/LRP8, LRP1 and LRP1B, as well as Megalin/GP330, SorLA/LR11, LRP5, LRP6 and MEGF7. Recently several lines of evidence have positioned the LDL receptor gene family as one of the key players in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Initially this receptor family was of high interest due to its key function in cholesterol/apolipoprotein E (ApoE) uptake, with the epsilon4 allele of ApoE as the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. It has been established that the cholesterol metabolism of the cell has a strong impact on the production of Abeta, the major component of the plaques found in the brain of AD-patients. The original report that soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing the kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain might act as a ligand for LRP1 led to a complex investigation of the interaction of both proteins and their potential function in AD development. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that LRP1 might bind to APP independent of the KPI domain in APP. This APP - LRP1 interaction is facilitated through a trimeric complex of APP-FE65-LRP1, which has a functional role in APP processing. Along with LRP1, APP is transported from the early secretory compartments to the cell surface and subsequently internalised into the endosomal / lysosomal compartments. Recent investigations indicate that ApoER2 and SorLA fulfil a similar role in shifting APP localisation in the cell, which affects APP processing and the production of the APP derived amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). In addition to the effect of lipoprotein receptors on APP processing and Abeta production, LRP1 has been shown to bind Abeta directly or indirectly through Abeta-lactoferrin, Abeta-alpha2M and Abeta-ApoE complexes in vitro and in vivo. Based on these observations two LRP1 mediated clearance mechanisms of Abeta are proposed to play a crucial role in the prevention of AD: either Abeta-uptake into a cell with its subsequent degradation or its transport out of the brain over the blood brain barrier into the periphery. Following this export Abeta is degraded in the liver, where LRP1 potentially conducts the removal of Abeta from the blood stream. Although the involvement of LDLR family members in AD is not yet fully understood it becomes clear that they can directly affect APP production, Abeta-clearance and Abeta-transport over the blood brain barrier.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) binds to LDL receptor (LDLR) and targets it for lysosomal degradation in cells. Decreased hepatic clearance of plasma LDL-cholesterol is the primary gauge of PCSK9 activity in humans; however, PCSK9's evolutionary role may extend to other lipoprotein classes and processes. This review highlights studies that are providing novel insights into physiological regulation of PCSK9 transcription and plasma PCSK9 activity.\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that circulating PCSK9 binds to apolipoprotein B100 on LDL particles, which in turn inhibits PCSK9's ability to bind to cell surface LDLRs. Negative feedback of secreted PCSK9 activity by LDL could serve to increase plasma excursion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and monitor lipoprotein remodeling. Recent findings have identified hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α as a key transcriptional regulator that cooperates with sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 to control PCSK9 expression in hepatocytes in response to nutritional and hormonal inputs, as well as acute inflammation.\n",
      "PCSK9 is an established target for cholesterol-lowering therapies. Further study of PCSK9 regulatory mechanisms may identify additional control points for pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. PCSK9 function could reflect ancient roles in the fasting-feeding cycle and in linking lipoprotein metabolism with innate immunity.\n",

      "The SREBP2/LDLR pathway is sensitive to cholesterol content in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while membrane low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is influenced by sterol response element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL). LDL-C, one of the risk factors in cardiovascular disease, is cleared through endocytosis recycling of LDLR. Therefore, we propose that a balance between LDLR endocytosis recycling and PCSK9-mediated and IDOL-mediated lysosomal LDLR degradation is responsible for cholesterol homeostasis in the ER. For statins that decrease serum LDL-C levels via cholesterol synthesis inhibition, the mechanism by which the statins increase the membrane LDLR may be regulated by cholesterol homeostasis in the ER.\n",

      "Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting diet-induced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b(+/+) and Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, PPAR-delta, PPAR-gamma, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Excessive absorption of products of dietary fat digestion leads to type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related disorders. Mice deficient in the group 1B phospholipase A₂ (Pla2g1b), a gut digestive enzyme, are protected against diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes without displaying dietary lipid malabsorption. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Pla2g1b protects against diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Results showed that the Pla2g1b(-/-) mice had decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice subsequent to feeding a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (hypercaloric) diet. These differences were evident before differences in body weight gains were observed. Injection of Poloxamer 407 to inhibit lipolysis revealed decreased VLDL production in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. Supplementation with lysophosphatidylcholine, the product of Pla2g1b hydrolysis, restored VLDL production rates in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice and further elevated VLDL production in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed decreased postprandial lipidemia compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. These results show that, in addition to dietary fatty acids, gut-derived lysophospholipids derived from Pla2g1b hydrolysis of dietary and biliary phospholipids also promote hepatic VLDL production. Thus, the inhibition of lysophospholipid absorption via Pla2g1b inactivation may prove beneficial against diet-induced hyperlipidemia in addition to the protection against obesity and diabetes.\n",

      "Reelin is a glycoprotein that serves important roles both during development (regulation of neuronal migration and brain lamination) and in adulthood (maintenance of synaptic function). A number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Alzheimer's disease and lissencephaly share a common feature of abnormal Reelin expression in the brain. Altered Reelin expression has been hypothesized to impair neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity, leading ultimately to the cognitive deficits present in these disorders. The mechanisms for abnormal Reelin expression in some of these disorders are currently unknown although possible explanations include early developmental insults, mutations, hypermethylation of the promoter for the Reelin gene (RELN), miRNA silencing of Reelin mRNA, FMRP underexpression and Reelin processing abnormalities. Increasing Reelin expression through pharmacological therapies may help ameliorate symptoms resulting from Reelin deficits.

      "Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a major cause of developmental disabilities, severe epilepsy, and reproductive disadvantage. Genes that have been associated to MCD are mainly involved in cell proliferation and specification, neuronal migration, and late cortical organization. Lissencephaly-pachygyria-severe band heterotopia are diffuse neuronal migration disorders causing severe global neurological impairment. Abnormalities of the <i>LIS1, DCX, ARX</i>, <i>RELN</i>, <i>VLDLR</i>, <i>ACTB</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>TUBG1</i>, <i>KIF5C</i>, <i>KIF2A</i>, and <i>CDK5</i> genes have been associated with these malformations. More recent studies have also established a relationship between lissencephaly, with or without associated microcephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis as well as cerebellar hypoplasia, and at times, a morphological pattern consistent with polymicrogyria with mutations of several genes <i>(TUBA1A</i>, <i>TUBA8</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, <i>TUBB2B</i>, <i>TUBB3</i>, and <i>DYNC1H1)</i>, regulating the synthesis and function of microtubule and centrosome key components and hence defined as tubulinopathies. MCD only affecting subsets of neurons, such as mild subcortical band heterotopia and periventricular heterotopia, have been associated with abnormalities of the <i>DCX</i>, <i>FLN1A</i>, and <i>ARFGEF2</i> genes and cause neurological and cognitive impairment that vary from severe to mild deficits. Polymicrogyria results from abnormal late cortical organization and is inconstantly associated with abnormal neuronal migration. Localized polymicrogyria has been associated with anatomo-specific deficits, including disorders of language and higher cognition. Polymicrogyria is genetically heterogeneous, and only in a small minority of patients, a definite genetic cause has been identified. Megalencephaly with normal cortex or polymicrogyria by MRI imaging, hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia can all result from mutations in genes of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Postzygotic mutations have been described for most MCD and can be limited to the dysplastic tissue in the less diffuse forms.\n",

      "Proper neuronal migration and laminar formation during corticogenesis is essential for normal brain function. Disruption of these developmental processes is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of some neuropsychiatric conditions. Especially, Reelin, a glycoprotein mainly secreted by the Cajal-Retzius cells and a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons, has been shown to play a critical role, both during embryonic and postnatal periods. Indeed, animal studies have clearly revealed that Reelin is an essential molecule for proper migration of cortical neurons and finally regulates the cell positioning in the cortex during embryonic and early postnatal stages; by contrast, Reelin signaling is closely involved in synaptic function in adulthood. In humans, genetic studies have shown that the <i>reelin</i> gene (<i>RELN</i>) is associated with a number of psychiatric diseases, including Schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BP) and autistic spectrum disorder. Indeed, <i>Reln</i> haploinsufficiency has been shown to cause cognitive impairment in rodents, suggesting the expression level of the Reelin protein is closely related to the higher brain functions. However, the molecular abnormalities in the Reelin pathway involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders are not yet fully understood. In this article, we review the current progress in the understanding of the Reelin functions that could be related to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, we discuss the basis for selecting Reelin and molecules in its downstream signaling pathway as potential therapeutic targets for psychiatric illnesses.\n",

Emerging technologies to analyze the entire genome in large data sets have also revealed coding variants that increase AD risk: PLD3 and TREM2. We review the relationship between these AD risk genes and the cellular and neuropathologic features of AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, classified as either early onset (under 65 years of age), or late onset (over 65 years of age). Three main genes are involved in early onset AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele has been found to be a main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes that might be potential risk factors for AD, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Recent studies have discovered additional novel genes that might be involved in late-onset AD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). Identification of new AD-related genes is important for better understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Since the differential diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders are difficult, especially in the early stages, genetic testing is essential for diagnostic processes. Next-generation sequencing studies have been successfully used for detecting mutations, monitoring the epigenetic changes, and analyzing transcriptomes. These studies may be a promising approach toward understanding the complete genetic mechanisms of diverse genetic disorders such as AD.\n",

      "Whether cholesterol is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still controversial. Several studies that explored the association between lipids and/or lipid-lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ, CLU), ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7(ABCA7), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Functional cell biology studies further support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of Aβ precursor protein processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase resulting in altered Aβ production. However, conflicting evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk, randomized clinical trials observing no beneficial effect of statin therapy, and cell biology studies suggesting that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol level is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits colocalization of β-secretase 1 and Aβ precursor protein in nonraft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an Aβ-degrading enzyme. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the findings of epidemiological, genetic, and cell biology studies aiming to elucidate the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD.\n",

      "The liver and the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) play major roles in TG and VLDL metabolism. However, the exact role of liver VLDLR is not well known because of the absence of or difficulty in detecting VLDLR in the liver. In this study, we demonstrate that fenofibrate, a PPARα agonist and widely used TG-lowering drug, markedly upregulated hepatic VLDLR, which is essential for lowering TG. This study also shows that the distinct regulatory roles of PPARα agonists on VLDLR in the liver and peripheral tissues including adipose tissues, heart, and skeletal muscles are due to the pattern of expression of PPARα. The in vivo portion of our study demonstrated that oral fenofibrate robustly increased liver VLDLR expression levels in hyperlipidemic and diabetic mice and significantly reduced the increase in serum TG observed in wt mice after feeding with high-fat diet (HFD) but not in Vldlr(-/-) mice or Pparα(-/-) mice. However, overexpression of mouse VLDLR in livers of Vldlr(-/-) mice significantly prevented the increase in serum TG induced by HFD. The in vitro portion of our study showed that fenofibrate upregulated VLDLR transcriptional activity through PPAR response element binding to the VLDLR promoter. The conclusions of our study provide a novel mechanism for the TG-lowering effects of fenofibrate in the treatment of dyslipidemia.\n",

      "The VLDL receptor (VLDLR) is a member of the LDL receptor family. The VLDLR was hypothesized to mediate fatty acid entry into peripheral tissues, on the basis of its expression in tissues that are active in fatty acid metabolism and its capacity to bind apolipoprotein-E-rich VLDL in vitro. This hypothesis initially proved difficult to confirm, because VLDLR-knockout mice were reported to display normal plasma lipid levels. Moreover, studies in VLDLR-knockout mice that were also deficient in a second LDL receptor family member, the apolipoprotein E receptor 2, indicated a role for the VLDLR in neuronal migration during brain development. However, in accordance with what the term VLDLR suggests, recent studies using VLDLR-deficient and transgenic mice have provided compelling evidence that the VLDLR does indeed play a role in VLDL-triglyceride metabolism, and that it is important for triglyceride storage in the adipocyte.\n",

      "Embraced with apolipoproteins (Apo) B and Apo E, triglyceride-enriched very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is secreted by the liver into circulation, mainly during post-meal hours. Here, we present a brief review of the physiological role of VLDL and a systemic review of the emerging evidence supporting its pathological roles. VLDL promotes atherosclerosis in metabolic syndrome (MetS). VLDL isolated from subjects with MetS exhibits cytotoxicity to atrial myocytes, induces atrial myopathy, and promotes vulnerability to atrial fibrillation. VLDL levels are affected by a number of endocrinological disorders and can be increased by therapeutic supplementation with cortisol, growth hormone, progesterone, and estrogen. VLDL promotes aldosterone secretion, which contributes to hypertension. VLDL induces neuroinflammation, leading to cognitive dysfunction. VLDL levels are also correlated with chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disorders, and some dermatological diseases. The extra-hepatic secretion of VLDL derived from intestinal dysbiosis is suggested to be harmful. Emerging evidence suggests disturbed VLDL metabolism in sleep disorders and in cancer development and progression. In addition to VLDL, the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) may affect both VLDL metabolism and carcinogenesis. Overall, emerging evidence supports the pathological roles of VLDL in multi-organ diseases. To better understand the fundamental mechanisms of how VLDL promotes disease development, elucidation of the quality control of VLDL and of the regulation and signaling of VLDLR should be indispensable. With this, successful VLDL-targeted therapies can be discovered in the future.\n",

      "High amylase activity in dogs is associated with a drastic increase in copy numbers of the gene coding for pancreatic amylase, AMY2B, that likely allowed dogs to thrive on a relatively starch-rich diet during early dog domestication. Although most dogs thus probably digest starch more efficiently than do wolves, AMY2B copy numbers vary widely within the dog population, and it is not clear how this variation affects the individual ability to handle starch nor how it affects dog health. In humans, copy numbers of the gene coding for salivary amylase, AMY1, correlate with both salivary amylase levels and enzyme activity, and high amylase activity is related to improved glycemic homeostasis and lower frequencies of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigate the relationship between AMY2B copy numbers and serum amylase activity in dogs and show that amylase activity correlates with AMY2B copy numbers. We then describe how AMY2B copy numbers vary in individuals from 20 dog breeds and find strong breed-dependent patterns, indicating that the ability to digest starch varies both at the breed and individual level. Finally, to test whether AMY2B copy number is strongly associated with the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, we compare copy numbers in cases and controls as well as in breeds with varying diabetes susceptibility. Although we see no such association here, future studies using larger cohorts are needed before excluding a possible link between AMY2B and diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent, and physical exercise represents one of the most effective methods to attenuate NAFLD. However, the mechanism of aerobic exercise improving NAFLD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on CNPY2-PERK pathway in mice with NAFLD. Our study found that a high-fat diet induced NAFLD, causing an abnormal lipid metabolism and liver function injury, and increased the expressions of CNPY2, CNPY2 mRNA, PERK, PERK mRNA, p-eIF2a and CHOP. However, aerobic exercise reversesd all these parameters. These data suggest that CNPY2-PERK pathway is involved in the formation of NAFLD, and aerobic exercise can effectively improve NAFLD, which may be related to down-regulate the protein expressions of the CNPY2-PERK pathway.\n",

      "EGFL7 is a secreted angiogenic factor that is highly conserved in vertebrates. Most secreted angiogenic signaling molecules, including VEGF and fibroblast growth factor-2, are mainly expressed by non-endothelial cell types such as fibroblasts. In contrast, EGFL7 is unique because it is almost exclusively expressed by and acts on endothelial cells. Egfl7 expression is highest when the endothelium is in an active, proliferating state. This factor acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and binds to components of the extracellular matrix. In vivo, Egfl7 is important for regulating tubulogenesis in zebrafish and for controlling vascular patterning and integrity in mice. Its function in blood vessel development is mediated, at least in part, through modulation of Notch signaling. In this review, we summarize the findings that support a role for Egfl7 in developmental and postnatal angiogenesis and describe the EGFL7-signaling pathways that underlie these processes. In addition, we discuss a potential role for EGFL7 in vascular repair and its possible use as a therapeutic target for treatment of hypoxia-induced injury. Finally, we consider EGFL7 action during tumorigenesis and its potential as an antiangiogenic agent.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein 7 (EGFL7), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family, is a potent angiogenic factor expressed in many different cell types. EGFL7 plays a vital role in controlling vascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the main signaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulating evidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has been frequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma, colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression of miR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role in oncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in both the osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activities via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of its angiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, such as ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.\n",

      "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis and permeability should enable the development of more effective therapies for various diseases, including retinopathy, cancer, and other vascular disorders. We focused on epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) which plays an important role in NOTCH signaling and in the organization of angiogenic sprouts. We developed an EGFL7-knockdown in vitro microvessel model and investigated the effect of EGFL7 at a tissue level. We found EGFL7 knockdown suppressed VEGF-A-induced sprouting angiogenesis accompanied by an overproduction of endothelial filopodia and reduced collagen IV deposition at the basal side of endothelial cells. We also observed impaired barrier function which reflected an inflammatory condition. Furthermore, our results showed that proper formation of adherens junctions and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was disturbed. In conclusion, by using a 3D microvessel model we identified novel roles for EGFL7 in endothelial function during sprouting angiogenesis.\n",

      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "The angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4 and 8 have emerged as key regulators of plasma lipid metabolism by serving as potent inhibitors of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In this review, we provide an integrated picture of the role of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 in lipid metabolism by focusing on their impact on LPL activity and plasma triglyceride clearance during physiological conditions such as fasting, refeeding, exercise and cold exposure.\n",
      "Upon refeeding, circulating ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 promote the replenishment of white adipose tissue depots by specifically inhibiting LPL activity in oxidative tissues. During exercise and cold exposure, ANGPTL4 represses local LPL activity to assure that plasma triglycerides are specifically shuttled to exercising muscle and brown adipose tissue, respectively. Overall, ANGPTL4 is the central component of a fatty acid-driven feedback mechanism that regulates plasma triglyceride hydrolysis and subsequent tissue fatty acid uptake in response to changes in lipid availability and cellular fuel demand.\n",
      "ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 together ensure that triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are adequately distributed during different physiological conditions. The impact of the ANGPTLs on plasma lipid levels has led to scrutiny of ANGPTLs as therapeutic targets for dyslipidemia.\n",

      "Microglia, once viewed as static bystanders with limited homeostatic functions, are now considered key players in the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial activation is a salient feature of neuroinflammation involving a dynamic process that generates multitudinous microglial phenotypes that can respond to a variety of situational cues in the central nervous system. Recently, a flurry of single cell RNA-sequencing studies have defined microglial phenotypes in unprecedented detail, and have highlighted robust changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Increased expression of genes such as Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) in microglia during development, damage, and disease, suggest that increased lipid metabolism is needed to fuel protective cellular functions such as phagocytosis. This review describes our current understanding of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in microglia, and highlights microglial lipid metabolism as a modifiable target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "A major step in energy metabolism is hydrolysis of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) to release fatty acids that can be used or stored. This is accomplished by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at 'binding lipolysis sites' at the vascular endothelium. A multitude of interactions are involved in this seemingly simple reaction. Recent advances in the understanding of some of these factors will be discussed in an attempt to build a comprehensive picture.\n",
      "The first event in catabolism of TRLs is that they dock at the vascular endothelium. This requires LPL and GPIHBP1, the endothelial transporter of LPL.Kinetic studies in rats with labeled chylomicrons showed that once a chylomicron has docked in the heart it stays for minutes and a large number of triacylglycerol molecules are split. The distribution of binding between tissues reflects the amount of LPL, as evident from studies with mutant mice.Clearance of TRLs is often slowed down in metabolic disease, as was demonstrated both in mice and men. In mice, this was directly connected to decreased amounts of endothelial LPL.\n",

      "The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is the founding member of a family of seven structurally closely related transmembrane proteins (LRP1, LRP1b, megalin/LRP2, LDL receptor, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, MEGF7/LRP4, LRP8/apolipoprotein E receptor2). These proteins participate in a wide range of physiological processes, including the regulation of lipid metabolism, protection against atherosclerosis, neurodevelopment, and transport of nutrients and vitamins. While currently available data suggest that the role of the LDL receptor is limited to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles, there is growing experimental evidence that the other members of the gene family have additional physiological functions as signal transducers. In this review, we focus on the latest discovered functions of two major members of this family, LRP1 and megalin/LRP2, and on the newly elucidated physiological role of a third member of the family, MEGF7/LRP4, which can also function as a modulator of diverse signaling pathways during development.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized with progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature that occurs prior to neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction. Mounting evidence suggests that aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau leads to synaptic deficits and neurodegeneration, thereby to memory loss. Among the established genetic risk factors for AD, the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor. We and others previously demonstrated that apoE regulates Aβ aggregation and clearance in an isoform-dependent manner. While the effect of apoE on Aβ may explain how apoE isoforms differentially affect AD pathogenesis, there are also other underexplored pathogenic mechanisms. They include differential effects of apoE on cerebral energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, neurovascular function, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. ApoE is a major carrier of cholesterols that are required for neuronal activity and injury repair in the brain. Although there are a few conflicting findings and the underlying mechanism is still unclear, several lines of studies demonstrated that apoE4 leads to synaptic deficits and impairment in long-term potentiation, memory and cognition. In this review, we summarize current understanding of apoE function in the brain, with a particular emphasis on its role in synaptic plasticity and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, involving low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), syndecan, and LRP8/ApoER2.\n",

      "The LDL receptor gene family constitutes a class of structurally closely related cell surface receptors fulfilling diverse functions in different organs, tissues, and cell types. The LDL receptor is the prototype of this family, which also includes the VLDLR, ApoER2/LRP8, LRP1 and LRP1B, as well as Megalin/GP330, SorLA/LR11, LRP5, LRP6 and MEGF7. Recently several lines of evidence have positioned the LDL receptor gene family as one of the key players in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Initially this receptor family was of high interest due to its key function in cholesterol/apolipoprotein E (ApoE) uptake, with the epsilon4 allele of ApoE as the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. It has been established that the cholesterol metabolism of the cell has a strong impact on the production of Abeta, the major component of the plaques found in the brain of AD-patients. The original report that soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing the kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain might act as a ligand for LRP1 led to a complex investigation of the interaction of both proteins and their potential function in AD development. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that LRP1 might bind to APP independent of the KPI domain in APP. This APP - LRP1 interaction is facilitated through a trimeric complex of APP-FE65-LRP1, which has a functional role in APP processing. Along with LRP1, APP is transported from the early secretory compartments to the cell surface and subsequently internalised into the endosomal / lysosomal compartments. Recent investigations indicate that ApoER2 and SorLA fulfil a similar role in shifting APP localisation in the cell, which affects APP processing and the production of the APP derived amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). In addition to the effect of lipoprotein receptors on APP processing and Abeta production, LRP1 has been shown to bind Abeta directly or indirectly through Abeta-lactoferrin, Abeta-alpha2M and Abeta-ApoE complexes in vitro and in vivo. Based on these observations two LRP1 mediated clearance mechanisms of Abeta are proposed to play a crucial role in the prevention of AD: either Abeta-uptake into a cell with its subsequent degradation or its transport out of the brain over the blood brain barrier into the periphery. Following this export Abeta is degraded in the liver, where LRP1 potentially conducts the removal of Abeta from the blood stream. Although the involvement of LDLR family members in AD is not yet fully understood it becomes clear that they can directly affect APP production, Abeta-clearance and Abeta-transport over the blood brain barrier.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

Decreased hepatic clearance of plasma LDL-cholesterol is the primary gauge of PCSK9 activity in humans; however, PCSK9's evolutionary role may extend to other lipoprotein classes and processes. This review highlights studies that are providing novel insights into physiological regulation of PCSK9 transcription and plasma PCSK9 activity.\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that circulating PCSK9 binds to apolipoprotein B100 on LDL particles, which in turn inhibits PCSK9's ability to bind to cell surface LDLRs. Negative feedback of secreted PCSK9 activity by LDL could serve to increase plasma excursion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and monitor lipoprotein remodeling. Recent findings have identified hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α as a key transcriptional regulator that cooperates with sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 to control PCSK9 expression in hepatocytes in response to nutritional and hormonal inputs, as well as acute inflammation.\n",

Further study of PCSK9 regulatory mechanisms may identify additional control points for pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation.

LDL-C, one of the risk factors in cardiovascular disease, is cleared through endocytosis recycling of LDLR. Therefore, we propose that a balance between LDLR endocytosis recycling and PCSK9-mediated and IDOL-mediated lysosomal LDLR degradation is responsible for cholesterol homeostasis in the ER. For statins that decrease serum LDL-C levels via cholesterol synthesis inhibition, the mechanism by which the statins increase the membrane LDLR may be regulated by cholesterol homeostasis in the ER.\n",

      "Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting diet-induced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b(+/+) and Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, PPAR-delta, PPAR-gamma, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Excessive absorption of products of dietary fat digestion leads to type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related disorders. Mice deficient in the group 1B phospholipase A₂ (Pla2g1b), a gut digestive enzyme, are protected against diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes without displaying dietary lipid malabsorption. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Pla2g1b protects against diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Results showed that the Pla2g1b(-/-) mice had decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice subsequent to feeding a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (hypercaloric) diet. These differences were evident before differences in body weight gains were observed. Injection of Poloxamer 407 to inhibit lipolysis revealed decreased VLDL production in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. Supplementation with lysophosphatidylcholine, the product of Pla2g1b hydrolysis, restored VLDL production rates in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice and further elevated VLDL production in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed decreased postprandial lipidemia compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. These results show that, in addition to dietary fatty acids, gut-derived lysophospholipids derived from Pla2g1b hydrolysis of dietary and biliary phospholipids also promote hepatic VLDL production. Thus, the inhibition of lysophospholipid absorption via Pla2g1b inactivation may prove beneficial against diet-induced hyperlipidemia in addition to the protection against obesity and diabetes.\n",

      "Immunity to intestinal helminth infections has been well studied, but the mechanism of helminth killing prior to expulsion remains unclear. Here we identify epithelial-cell-derived phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> group 1B (PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B) as a host-derived endogenous anthelmintic. PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B is elevated in resistant mice and is responsible for killing tissue-embedded larvae. Despite comparable activities of other essential type-2-dependent immune mechanisms, Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to expel the intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Expression of Pla2g1b by epithelial cells was dependent upon intestinal microbiota, adaptive immunity, and common-gamma chain-dependent signaling. Notably, Pla2g1b was downregulated in susceptible mice and inhibited by IL-4R-signaling in vitro, uncoupling parasite killing from expulsion mechanisms. Resistance was restored in Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice by treating infective H. polygyrus L3 larvae with PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B, which reduced larval phospholipid abundance. These findings uncover epithelial-cell-derived Pla2g1b as an essential mediator of helminth killing, highlighting a previously overlooked mechanism of anti-helminth immunity.\n",

      "Reelin is a glycoprotein that serves important roles both during development (regulation of neuronal migration and brain lamination) and in adulthood (maintenance of synaptic function). A number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Alzheimer's disease and lissencephaly share a common feature of abnormal Reelin expression in the brain. Altered Reelin expression has been hypothesized to impair neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity, leading ultimately to the cognitive deficits present in these disorders. The mechanisms for abnormal Reelin expression in some of these disorders are currently unknown although possible explanations include early developmental insults, mutations, hypermethylation of the promoter for the Reelin gene (RELN), miRNA silencing of Reelin mRNA, FMRP underexpression and Reelin processing abnormalities. Increasing Reelin expression through pharmacological therapies may help ameliorate symptoms resulting from Reelin deficits.

      "Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a major cause of developmental disabilities, severe epilepsy, and reproductive disadvantage. Genes that have been associated to MCD are mainly involved in cell proliferation and specification, neuronal migration, and late cortical organization. Lissencephaly-pachygyria-severe band heterotopia are diffuse neuronal migration disorders causing severe global neurological impairment. Abnormalities of the <i>LIS1, DCX, ARX</i>, <i>RELN</i>, <i>VLDLR</i>, <i>ACTB</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>TUBG1</i>, <i>KIF5C</i>, <i>KIF2A</i>, and <i>CDK5</i> genes have been associated with these malformations. More recent studies have also established a relationship between lissencephaly, with or without associated microcephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis as well as cerebellar hypoplasia, and at times, a morphological pattern consistent with polymicrogyria with mutations of several genes <i>(TUBA1A</i>, <i>TUBA8</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, <i>TUBB2B</i>, <i>TUBB3</i>, and <i>DYNC1H1)</i>, regulating the synthesis and function of microtubule and centrosome key components and hence defined as tubulinopathies. MCD only affecting subsets of neurons, such as mild subcortical band heterotopia and periventricular heterotopia, have been associated with abnormalities of the <i>DCX</i>, <i>FLN1A</i>, and <i>ARFGEF2</i> genes and cause neurological and cognitive impairment that vary from severe to mild deficits. Polymicrogyria results from abnormal late cortical organization and is inconstantly associated with abnormal neuronal migration. Localized polymicrogyria has been associated with anatomo-specific deficits, including disorders of language and higher cognition. Polymicrogyria is genetically heterogeneous, and only in a small minority of patients, a definite genetic cause has been identified. Megalencephaly with normal cortex or polymicrogyria by MRI imaging, hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia can all result from mutations in genes of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Postzygotic mutations have been described for most MCD and can be limited to the dysplastic tissue in the less diffuse forms.\n",

      "Proper neuronal migration and laminar formation during corticogenesis is essential for normal brain function. Disruption of these developmental processes is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of some neuropsychiatric conditions. Especially, Reelin, a glycoprotein mainly secreted by the Cajal-Retzius cells and a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons, has been shown to play a critical role, both during embryonic and postnatal periods. Indeed, animal studies have clearly revealed that Reelin is an essential molecule for proper migration of cortical neurons and finally regulates the cell positioning in the cortex during embryonic and early postnatal stages; by contrast, Reelin signaling is closely involved in synaptic function in adulthood. In humans, genetic studies have shown that the <i>reelin</i> gene (<i>RELN</i>) is associated with a number of psychiatric diseases, including Schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BP) and autistic spectrum disorder. Indeed, <i>Reln</i> haploinsufficiency has been shown to cause cognitive impairment in rodents, suggesting the expression level of the Reelin protein is closely related to the higher brain functions. However, the molecular abnormalities in the Reelin pathway involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders are not yet fully understood. In this article, we review the current progress in the understanding of the Reelin functions that could be related to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, we discuss the basis for selecting Reelin and molecules in its downstream signaling pathway as potential therapeutic targets for psychiatric illnesses.\n",

      "We review the genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their role in AD pathogenesis. More recent advances in understanding of the human genome-technologic advances in methods to analyze millions of polymorphisms in thousands of subjects-have revealed new genes associated with AD risk, including ABCA7, BIN1, CASS4, CD33, CD2AP, CELF1, CLU, CR1, DSG2, EPHA1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5-DBR1, INPP5D, MS4A, MEF2C, NME8, PICALM, PTK2B, SLC24H4-RIN3, SORL1, and ZCWPW1. Emerging technologies to analyze the entire genome in large data sets have also revealed coding variants that increase AD risk: PLD3 and TREM2. We review the relationship between these AD risk genes and the cellular and neuropathologic features of AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, classified as either early onset (under 65 years of age), or late onset (over 65 years of age). Three main genes are involved in early onset AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele has been found to be a main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes that might be potential risk factors for AD, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Recent studies have discovered additional novel genes that might be involved in late-onset AD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). Identification of new AD-related genes is important for better understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Since the differential diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders are difficult, especially in the early stages, genetic testing is essential for diagnostic processes. Next-generation sequencing studies have been successfully used for detecting mutations, monitoring the epigenetic changes, and analyzing transcriptomes. These studies may be a promising approach toward understanding the complete genetic mechanisms of diverse genetic disorders such as AD.\n",

      "Whether cholesterol is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still controversial. Several studies that explored the association between lipids and/or lipid-lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ, CLU), ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7(ABCA7), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Functional cell biology studies further support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of Aβ precursor protein processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase resulting in altered Aβ production. However, conflicting evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk, randomized clinical trials observing no beneficial effect of statin therapy, and cell biology studies suggesting that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol level is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits colocalization of β-secretase 1 and Aβ precursor protein in nonraft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an Aβ-degrading enzyme. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the findings of epidemiological, genetic, and cell biology studies aiming to elucidate the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD.\n",

      "The liver and the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) play major roles in TG and VLDL metabolism. However, the exact role of liver VLDLR is not well known because of the absence of or difficulty in detecting VLDLR in the liver. In this study, we demonstrate that fenofibrate, a PPARα agonist and widely used TG-lowering drug, markedly upregulated hepatic VLDLR, which is essential for lowering TG. This study also shows that the distinct regulatory roles of PPARα agonists on VLDLR in the liver and peripheral tissues including adipose tissues, heart, and skeletal muscles are due to the pattern of expression of PPARα. The in vivo portion of our study demonstrated that oral fenofibrate robustly increased liver VLDLR expression levels in hyperlipidemic and diabetic mice and significantly reduced the increase in serum TG observed in wt mice after feeding with high-fat diet (HFD) but not in Vldlr(-/-) mice or Pparα(-/-) mice. However, overexpression of mouse VLDLR in livers of Vldlr(-/-) mice significantly prevented the increase in serum TG induced by HFD. The in vitro portion of our study showed that fenofibrate upregulated VLDLR transcriptional activity through PPAR response element binding to the VLDLR promoter. The conclusions of our study provide a novel mechanism for the TG-lowering effects of fenofibrate in the treatment of dyslipidemia.\n",

      "The VLDL receptor (VLDLR) is a member of the LDL receptor family. The VLDLR was hypothesized to mediate fatty acid entry into peripheral tissues, on the basis of its expression in tissues that are active in fatty acid metabolism and its capacity to bind apolipoprotein-E-rich VLDL in vitro. This hypothesis initially proved difficult to confirm, because VLDLR-knockout mice were reported to display normal plasma lipid levels. Moreover, studies in VLDLR-knockout mice that were also deficient in a second LDL receptor family member, the apolipoprotein E receptor 2, indicated a role for the VLDLR in neuronal migration during brain development. However, in accordance with what the term VLDLR suggests, recent studies using VLDLR-deficient and transgenic mice have provided compelling evidence that the VLDLR does indeed play a role in VLDL-triglyceride metabolism, and that it is important for triglyceride storage in the adipocyte.\n",

      "Embraced with apolipoproteins (Apo) B and Apo E, triglyceride-enriched very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is secreted by the liver into circulation, mainly during post-meal hours. Here, we present a brief review of the physiological role of VLDL and a systemic review of the emerging evidence supporting its pathological roles. VLDL promotes atherosclerosis in metabolic syndrome (MetS). VLDL isolated from subjects with MetS exhibits cytotoxicity to atrial myocytes, induces atrial myopathy, and promotes vulnerability to atrial fibrillation. VLDL levels are affected by a number of endocrinological disorders and can be increased by therapeutic supplementation with cortisol, growth hormone, progesterone, and estrogen. VLDL promotes aldosterone secretion, which contributes to hypertension. VLDL induces neuroinflammation, leading to cognitive dysfunction. VLDL levels are also correlated with chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disorders, and some dermatological diseases. The extra-hepatic secretion of VLDL derived from intestinal dysbiosis is suggested to be harmful. Emerging evidence suggests disturbed VLDL metabolism in sleep disorders and in cancer development and progression. In addition to VLDL, the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) may affect both VLDL metabolism and carcinogenesis. Overall, emerging evidence supports the pathological roles of VLDL in multi-organ diseases. To better understand the fundamental mechanisms of how VLDL promotes disease development, elucidation of the quality control of VLDL and of the regulation and signaling of VLDLR should be indispensable. With this, successful VLDL-targeted therapies can be discovered in the future.\n",

      "High amylase activity in dogs is associated with a drastic increase in copy numbers of the gene coding for pancreatic amylase, AMY2B, that likely allowed dogs to thrive on a relatively starch-rich diet during early dog domestication. Although most dogs thus probably digest starch more efficiently than do wolves, AMY2B copy numbers vary widely within the dog population, and it is not clear how this variation affects the individual ability to handle starch nor how it affects dog health. In humans, copy numbers of the gene coding for salivary amylase, AMY1, correlate with both salivary amylase levels and enzyme activity, and high amylase activity is related to improved glycemic homeostasis and lower frequencies of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigate the relationship between AMY2B copy numbers and serum amylase activity in dogs and show that amylase activity correlates with AMY2B copy numbers. We then describe how AMY2B copy numbers vary in individuals from 20 dog breeds and find strong breed-dependent patterns, indicating that the ability to digest starch varies both at the breed and individual level. Finally, to test whether AMY2B copy number is strongly associated with the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, we compare copy numbers in cases and controls as well as in breeds with varying diabetes susceptibility. Although we see no such association here, future studies using larger cohorts are needed before excluding a possible link between AMY2B and diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Prolonged human interactions and artificial selection have influenced the genotypic and phenotypic diversity among dog breeds. Because humans and dogs occupy diverse habitats, ecological contexts have likely contributed to breed-specific positive selection. Prior to the advent of modern dog-feeding practices, there was likely substantial variation in dietary landscapes among disparate dog breeds. As such, we investigated one type of genetic variant, copy number variation, in three metabolic genes: glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), phytanol-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH), and pancreatic α-amylase 2B (AMY2B). These genes code for proteins that are responsible for metabolizing dietary products that originate from distinctly different food types: sugar, meat, and starch, respectively. After surveying copy number variation among dogs with diverse dietary histories, we found no correlation between diet and positive selection in either GCKR or PHYH. Although it has been previously demonstrated that dogs experienced a copy number increase in AMY2B relative to wolves during or after the dog domestication process, we demonstrate that positive selection continued to act on amylase copy number in dog breeds that consumed starch-rich diets in time periods after domestication. Furthermore, we found that introgression with wolves is not responsible for deterioration of positive selection on AMY2B among diverse dog breeds. Together, this supports the hypothesis that the amylase copy number expansion is found universally in dogs.\n",

      "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent, and physical exercise represents one of the most effective methods to attenuate NAFLD. However, the mechanism of aerobic exercise improving NAFLD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on CNPY2-PERK pathway in mice with NAFLD. Our study found that a high-fat diet induced NAFLD, causing an abnormal lipid metabolism and liver function injury, and increased the expressions of CNPY2, CNPY2 mRNA, PERK, PERK mRNA, p-eIF2a and CHOP. However, aerobic exercise reversesd all these parameters. These data suggest that CNPY2-PERK pathway is involved in the formation of NAFLD, and aerobic exercise can effectively improve NAFLD, which may be related to down-regulate the protein expressions of the CNPY2-PERK pathway.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "EGFL7 is a secreted angiogenic factor that is highly conserved in vertebrates. Most secreted angiogenic signaling molecules, including VEGF and fibroblast growth factor-2, are mainly expressed by non-endothelial cell types such as fibroblasts. In contrast, EGFL7 is unique because it is almost exclusively expressed by and acts on endothelial cells. Egfl7 expression is highest when the endothelium is in an active, proliferating state. This factor acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and binds to components of the extracellular matrix. In vivo, Egfl7 is important for regulating tubulogenesis in zebrafish and for controlling vascular patterning and integrity in mice. Its function in blood vessel development is mediated, at least in part, through modulation of Notch signaling. In this review, we summarize the findings that support a role for Egfl7 in developmental and postnatal angiogenesis and describe the EGFL7-signaling pathways that underlie these processes. In addition, we discuss a potential role for EGFL7 in vascular repair and its possible use as a therapeutic target for treatment of hypoxia-induced injury. Finally, we consider EGFL7 action during tumorigenesis and its potential as an antiangiogenic agent.\n",

      "Epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein 7 (EGFL7), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family, is a potent angiogenic factor expressed in many different cell types. EGFL7 plays a vital role in controlling vascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the main signaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulating evidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has been frequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma, colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression of miR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role in oncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in both the osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activities via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of its angiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, such as ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.\n",

      "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis and permeability should enable the development of more effective therapies for various diseases, including retinopathy, cancer, and other vascular disorders. We focused on epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) which plays an important role in NOTCH signaling and in the organization of angiogenic sprouts. We developed an EGFL7-knockdown in vitro microvessel model and investigated the effect of EGFL7 at a tissue level. We found EGFL7 knockdown suppressed VEGF-A-induced sprouting angiogenesis accompanied by an overproduction of endothelial filopodia and reduced collagen IV deposition at the basal side of endothelial cells. We also observed impaired barrier function which reflected an inflammatory condition. Furthermore, our results showed that proper formation of adherens junctions and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was disturbed. In conclusion, by using a 3D microvessel model we identified novel roles for EGFL7 in endothelial function during sprouting angiogenesis.\n",

Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "The angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4 and 8 have emerged as key regulators of plasma lipid metabolism by serving as potent inhibitors of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In this review, we provide an integrated picture of the role of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 in lipid metabolism by focusing on their impact on LPL activity and plasma triglyceride clearance during physiological conditions such as fasting, refeeding, exercise and cold exposure.\n",
      "Upon refeeding, circulating ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 promote the replenishment of white adipose tissue depots by specifically inhibiting LPL activity in oxidative tissues. During exercise and cold exposure, ANGPTL4 represses local LPL activity to assure that plasma triglycerides are specifically shuttled to exercising muscle and brown adipose tissue, respectively. Overall, ANGPTL4 is the central component of a fatty acid-driven feedback mechanism that regulates plasma triglyceride hydrolysis and subsequent tissue fatty acid uptake in response to changes in lipid availability and cellular fuel demand.\n",
      "ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 together ensure that triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are adequately distributed during different physiological conditions. The impact of the ANGPTLs on plasma lipid levels has led to scrutiny of ANGPTLs as therapeutic targets for dyslipidemia.\n",

      "Microglia, once viewed as static bystanders with limited homeostatic functions, are now considered key players in the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial activation is a salient feature of neuroinflammation involving a dynamic process that generates multitudinous microglial phenotypes that can respond to a variety of situational cues in the central nervous system. Recently, a flurry of single cell RNA-sequencing studies have defined microglial phenotypes in unprecedented detail, and have highlighted robust changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Increased expression of genes such as Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) in microglia during development, damage, and disease, suggest that increased lipid metabolism is needed to fuel protective cellular functions such as phagocytosis. This review describes our current understanding of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in microglia, and highlights microglial lipid metabolism as a modifiable target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "A major step in energy metabolism is hydrolysis of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) to release fatty acids that can be used or stored. This is accomplished by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at 'binding lipolysis sites' at the vascular endothelium. A multitude of interactions are involved in this seemingly simple reaction. Recent advances in the understanding of some of these factors will be discussed in an attempt to build a comprehensive picture.\n",
      "The first event in catabolism of TRLs is that they dock at the vascular endothelium. This requires LPL and GPIHBP1, the endothelial transporter of LPL.Kinetic studies in rats with labeled chylomicrons showed that once a chylomicron has docked in the heart it stays for minutes and a large number of triacylglycerol molecules are split. The distribution of binding between tissues reflects the amount of LPL, as evident from studies with mutant mice.Clearance of TRLs is often slowed down in metabolic disease, as was demonstrated both in mice and men. In mice, this was directly connected to decreased amounts of endothelial LPL.\n",

      "The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is the founding member of a family of seven structurally closely related transmembrane proteins (LRP1, LRP1b, megalin/LRP2, LDL receptor, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, MEGF7/LRP4, LRP8/apolipoprotein E receptor2). These proteins participate in a wide range of physiological processes, including the regulation of lipid metabolism, protection against atherosclerosis, neurodevelopment, and transport of nutrients and vitamins. While currently available data suggest that the role of the LDL receptor is limited to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles, there is growing experimental evidence that the other members of the gene family have additional physiological functions as signal transducers. In this review, we focus on the latest discovered functions of two major members of this family, LRP1 and megalin/LRP2, and on the newly elucidated physiological role of a third member of the family, MEGF7/LRP4, which can also function as a modulator of diverse signaling pathways during development.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized with progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature that occurs prior to neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction. Mounting evidence suggests that aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau leads to synaptic deficits and neurodegeneration, thereby to memory loss. Among the established genetic risk factors for AD, the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor. We and others previously demonstrated that apoE regulates Aβ aggregation and clearance in an isoform-dependent manner. While the effect of apoE on Aβ may explain how apoE isoforms differentially affect AD pathogenesis, there are also other underexplored pathogenic mechanisms. They include differential effects of apoE on cerebral energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, neurovascular function, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. ApoE is a major carrier of cholesterols that are required for neuronal activity and injury repair in the brain. Although there are a few conflicting findings and the underlying mechanism is still unclear, several lines of studies demonstrated that apoE4 leads to synaptic deficits and impairment in long-term potentiation, memory and cognition. In this review, we summarize current understanding of apoE function in the brain, with a particular emphasis on its role in synaptic plasticity and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, involving low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), syndecan, and LRP8/ApoER2.\n",

      "The LDL receptor gene family constitutes a class of structurally closely related cell surface receptors fulfilling diverse functions in different organs, tissues, and cell types. The LDL receptor is the prototype of this family, which also includes the VLDLR, ApoER2/LRP8, LRP1 and LRP1B, as well as Megalin/GP330, SorLA/LR11, LRP5, LRP6 and MEGF7. Recently several lines of evidence have positioned the LDL receptor gene family as one of the key players in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Initially this receptor family was of high interest due to its key function in cholesterol/apolipoprotein E (ApoE) uptake, with the epsilon4 allele of ApoE as the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. It has been established that the cholesterol metabolism of the cell has a strong impact on the production of Abeta, the major component of the plaques found in the brain of AD-patients. The original report that soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing the kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain might act as a ligand for LRP1 led to a complex investigation of the interaction of both proteins and their potential function in AD development. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that LRP1 might bind to APP independent of the KPI domain in APP. This APP - LRP1 interaction is facilitated through a trimeric complex of APP-FE65-LRP1, which has a functional role in APP processing. Along with LRP1, APP is transported from the early secretory compartments to the cell surface and subsequently internalised into the endosomal / lysosomal compartments. Recent investigations indicate that ApoER2 and SorLA fulfil a similar role in shifting APP localisation in the cell, which affects APP processing and the production of the APP derived amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). In addition to the effect of lipoprotein receptors on APP processing and Abeta production, LRP1 has been shown to bind Abeta directly or indirectly through Abeta-lactoferrin, Abeta-alpha2M and Abeta-ApoE complexes in vitro and in vivo. Based on these observations two LRP1 mediated clearance mechanisms of Abeta are proposed to play a crucial role in the prevention of AD: either Abeta-uptake into a cell with its subsequent degradation or its transport out of the brain over the blood brain barrier into the periphery. Following this export Abeta is degraded in the liver, where LRP1 potentially conducts the removal of Abeta from the blood stream. Although the involvement of LDLR family members in AD is not yet fully understood it becomes clear that they can directly affect APP production, Abeta-clearance and Abeta-transport over the blood brain barrier.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) binds to LDL receptor (LDLR) and targets it for lysosomal degradation in cells. Decreased hepatic clearance of plasma LDL-cholesterol is the primary gauge of PCSK9 activity in humans; however, PCSK9's evolutionary role may extend to other lipoprotein classes and processes. This review highlights studies that are providing novel insights into physiological regulation of PCSK9 transcription and plasma PCSK9 activity.\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that circulating PCSK9 binds to apolipoprotein B100 on LDL particles, which in turn inhibits PCSK9's ability to bind to cell surface LDLRs. Negative feedback of secreted PCSK9 activity by LDL could serve to increase plasma excursion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and monitor lipoprotein remodeling. Recent findings have identified hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α as a key transcriptional regulator that cooperates with sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 to control PCSK9 expression in hepatocytes in response to nutritional and hormonal inputs, as well as acute inflammation.\n",
      "PCSK9 is an established target for cholesterol-lowering therapies. Further study of PCSK9 regulatory mechanisms may identify additional control points for pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. PCSK9 function could reflect ancient roles in the fasting-feeding cycle and in linking lipoprotein metabolism with innate immunity.\n",

      "The SREBP2/LDLR pathway is sensitive to cholesterol content in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while membrane low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is influenced by sterol response element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL). LDL-C, one of the risk factors in cardiovascular disease, is cleared through endocytosis recycling of LDLR. Therefore, we propose that a balance between LDLR endocytosis recycling and PCSK9-mediated and IDOL-mediated lysosomal LDLR degradation is responsible for cholesterol homeostasis in the ER. For statins that decrease serum LDL-C levels via cholesterol synthesis inhibition, the mechanism by which the statins increase the membrane LDLR may be regulated by cholesterol homeostasis in the ER.\n",

      "Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting diet-induced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b(+/+) and Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, PPAR-delta, PPAR-gamma, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Excessive absorption of products of dietary fat digestion leads to type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related disorders. Mice deficient in the group 1B phospholipase A₂ (Pla2g1b), a gut digestive enzyme, are protected against diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes without displaying dietary lipid malabsorption. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Pla2g1b protects against diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Results showed that the Pla2g1b(-/-) mice had decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice subsequent to feeding a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (hypercaloric) diet. These differences were evident before differences in body weight gains were observed. Injection of Poloxamer 407 to inhibit lipolysis revealed decreased VLDL production in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. Supplementation with lysophosphatidylcholine, the product of Pla2g1b hydrolysis, restored VLDL production rates in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice and further elevated VLDL production in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed decreased postprandial lipidemia compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. These results show that, in addition to dietary fatty acids, gut-derived lysophospholipids derived from Pla2g1b hydrolysis of dietary and biliary phospholipids also promote hepatic VLDL production. Thus, the inhibition of lysophospholipid absorption via Pla2g1b inactivation may prove beneficial against diet-induced hyperlipidemia in addition to the protection against obesity and diabetes.\n",

      "Immunity to intestinal helminth infections has been well studied, but the mechanism of helminth killing prior to expulsion remains unclear. Here we identify epithelial-cell-derived phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> group 1B (PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B) as a host-derived endogenous anthelmintic. PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B is elevated in resistant mice and is responsible for killing tissue-embedded larvae. Despite comparable activities of other essential type-2-dependent immune mechanisms, Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to expel the intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Expression of Pla2g1b by epithelial cells was dependent upon intestinal microbiota, adaptive immunity, and common-gamma chain-dependent signaling. Notably, Pla2g1b was downregulated in susceptible mice and inhibited by IL-4R-signaling in vitro, uncoupling parasite killing from expulsion mechanisms. Resistance was restored in Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice by treating infective H. polygyrus L3 larvae with PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B, which reduced larval phospholipid abundance. These findings uncover epithelial-cell-derived Pla2g1b as an essential mediator of helminth killing, highlighting a previously overlooked mechanism of anti-helminth immunity.\n",

Altered Reelin expression has been hypothesized to impair neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity, leading ultimately to the cognitive deficits present in these disorders. The mechanisms for abnormal Reelin expression in some of these disorders are currently unknown although possible explanations include early developmental insults, mutations, hypermethylation of the promoter for the Reelin gene (RELN), miRNA silencing of Reelin mRNA, FMRP underexpression and Reelin processing abnormalities. Increasing Reelin expression through pharmacological therapies may help ameliorate symptoms resulting from Reelin deficits. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Neurodevelopmental Disorders'.\n",

      "Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a major cause of developmental disabilities, severe epilepsy, and reproductive disadvantage. Genes that have been associated to MCD are mainly involved in cell proliferation and specification, neuronal migration, and late cortical organization. Lissencephaly-pachygyria-severe band heterotopia are diffuse neuronal migration disorders causing severe global neurological impairment. Abnormalities of the <i>LIS1, DCX, ARX</i>, <i>RELN</i>, <i>VLDLR</i>, <i>ACTB</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>TUBG1</i>, <i>KIF5C</i>, <i>KIF2A</i>, and <i>CDK5</i> genes have been associated with these malformations. More recent studies have also established a relationship between lissencephaly, with or without associated microcephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis as well as cerebellar hypoplasia, and at times, a morphological pattern consistent with polymicrogyria with mutations of several genes <i>(TUBA1A</i>, <i>TUBA8</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, <i>TUBB2B</i>, <i>TUBB3</i>, and <i>DYNC1H1)</i>, regulating the synthesis and function of microtubule and centrosome key components and hence defined as tubulinopathies. MCD only affecting subsets of neurons, such as mild subcortical band heterotopia and periventricular heterotopia, have been associated with abnormalities of the <i>DCX</i>, <i>FLN1A</i>, and <i>ARFGEF2</i> genes and cause neurological and cognitive impairment that vary from severe to mild deficits. Polymicrogyria results from abnormal late cortical organization and is inconstantly associated with abnormal neuronal migration. Localized polymicrogyria has been associated with anatomo-specific deficits, including disorders of language and higher cognition. Polymicrogyria is genetically heterogeneous, and only in a small minority of patients, a definite genetic cause has been identified. Megalencephaly with normal cortex or polymicrogyria by MRI imaging, hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia can all result from mutations in genes of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Postzygotic mutations have been described for most MCD and can be limited to the dysplastic tissue in the less diffuse forms.\n",

Mutations of the GPR56 and SRPX2 genes have been related to isolated polymicrogyria. Focal migration abnormalities associated with abnormal cell types, such as focal cortical dysplasia, are highly epileptogenic and variably influence the functioning of the affected cortex. The functional consequences of abnormal neuronal migration are still poorly understood. Conservation of function in the malformed cortex, its atypical representation, and relocation outside the malformed area are all possible. Localization of function based on anatomic landmarks may not be reliable.\n",

      "We review the genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their role in AD pathogenesis. More recent advances in understanding of the human genome-technologic advances in methods to analyze millions of polymorphisms in thousands of subjects-have revealed new genes associated with AD risk, including ABCA7, BIN1, CASS4, CD33, CD2AP, CELF1, CLU, CR1, DSG2, EPHA1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5-DBR1, INPP5D, MS4A, MEF2C, NME8, PICALM, PTK2B, SLC24H4-RIN3, SORL1, and ZCWPW1. Emerging technologies to analyze the entire genome in large data sets have also revealed coding variants that increase AD risk: PLD3 and TREM2. We review the relationship between these AD risk genes and the cellular and neuropathologic features of AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, classified as either early onset (under 65 years of age), or late onset (over 65 years of age). Three main genes are involved in early onset AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele has been found to be a main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes that might be potential risk factors for AD, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Recent studies have discovered additional novel genes that might be involved in late-onset AD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). Identification of new AD-related genes is important for better understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Since the differential diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders are difficult, especially in the early stages, genetic testing is essential for diagnostic processes. Next-generation sequencing studies have been successfully used for detecting mutations, monitoring the epigenetic changes, and analyzing transcriptomes. These studies may be a promising approach toward understanding the complete genetic mechanisms of diverse genetic disorders such as AD.\n",

      "Whether cholesterol is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still controversial. Several studies that explored the association between lipids and/or lipid-lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ, CLU), ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7(ABCA7), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Functional cell biology studies further support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of Aβ precursor protein processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase resulting in altered Aβ production. However, conflicting evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk, randomized clinical trials observing no beneficial effect of statin therapy, and cell biology studies suggesting that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol level is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits colocalization of β-secretase 1 and Aβ precursor protein in nonraft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an Aβ-degrading enzyme. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the findings of epidemiological, genetic, and cell biology studies aiming to elucidate the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "Reelin is a large secreted glycoprotein that is essential for correct neuronal positioning during neurodevelopment and is important for synaptic plasticity in the mature brain. Moreover, Reelin is expressed in many extraneuronal tissues; yet the roles of peripheral Reelin are largely unknown. In the brain, many of Reelin's functions are mediated by a molecular signaling cascade that involves two lipoprotein receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (Apoer2) and very low density-lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr), the neuronal phosphoprotein Disabled-1 (Dab1), and members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases as crucial elements. This core signaling pathway in turn modulates the activity of adaptor proteins and downstream protein kinase cascades, many of which target the neuronal cytoskeleton. However, additional Reelin-binding receptors have been postulated or described, either as coreceptors that are essential for the activation of the \"canonical\" Reelin signaling cascade involving Apoer2/Vldlr and Dab1, or as receptors that activate alternative or additional signaling pathways. Here we will give an overview of canonical and alternative Reelin signaling pathways, molecular mechanisms involved, and their potential physiological roles in the context of different biological settings.\n",

      "High amylase activity in dogs is associated with a drastic increase in copy numbers of the gene coding for pancreatic amylase, AMY2B, that likely allowed dogs to thrive on a relatively starch-rich diet during early dog domestication. Although most dogs thus probably digest starch more efficiently than do wolves, AMY2B copy numbers vary widely within the dog population, and it is not clear how this variation affects the individual ability to handle starch nor how it affects dog health. In humans, copy numbers of the gene coding for salivary amylase, AMY1, correlate with both salivary amylase levels and enzyme activity, and high amylase activity is related to improved glycemic homeostasis and lower frequencies of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigate the relationship between AMY2B copy numbers and serum amylase activity in dogs and show that amylase activity correlates with AMY2B copy numbers. We then describe how AMY2B copy numbers vary in individuals from 20 dog breeds and find strong breed-dependent patterns, indicating that the ability to digest starch varies both at the breed and individual level. Finally, to test whether AMY2B copy number is strongly associated with the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, we compare copy numbers in cases and controls as well as in breeds with varying diabetes susceptibility. Although we see no such association here, future studies using larger cohorts are needed before excluding a possible link between AMY2B and diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Prolonged human interactions and artificial selection have influenced the genotypic and phenotypic diversity among dog breeds. Because humans and dogs occupy diverse habitats, ecological contexts have likely contributed to breed-specific positive selection. Prior to the advent of modern dog-feeding practices, there was likely substantial variation in dietary landscapes among disparate dog breeds. As such, we investigated one type of genetic variant, copy number variation, in three metabolic genes: glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), phytanol-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH), and pancreatic α-amylase 2B (AMY2B). These genes code for proteins that are responsible for metabolizing dietary products that originate from distinctly different food types: sugar, meat, and starch, respectively. After surveying copy number variation among dogs with diverse dietary histories, we found no correlation between diet and positive selection in either GCKR or PHYH. Although it has been previously demonstrated that dogs experienced a copy number increase in AMY2B relative to wolves during or after the dog domestication process, we demonstrate that positive selection continued to act on amylase copy number in dog breeds that consumed starch-rich diets in time periods after domestication. Furthermore, we found that introgression with wolves is not responsible for deterioration of positive selection on AMY2B among diverse dog breeds. Together, this supports the hypothesis that the amylase copy number expansion is found universally in dogs.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent, and physical exercise represents one of the most effective methods to attenuate NAFLD. However, the mechanism of aerobic exercise improving NAFLD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on CNPY2-PERK pathway in mice with NAFLD. Our study found that a high-fat diet induced NAFLD, causing an abnormal lipid metabolism and liver function injury, and increased the expressions of CNPY2, CNPY2 mRNA, PERK, PERK mRNA, p-eIF2a and CHOP. However, aerobic exercise reversesd all these parameters. These data suggest that CNPY2-PERK pathway is involved in the formation of NAFLD, and aerobic exercise can effectively improve NAFLD, which may be related to down-regulate the protein expressions of the CNPY2-PERK pathway.\n",

      "EGFL7 is a secreted angiogenic factor that is highly conserved in vertebrates. Most secreted angiogenic signaling molecules, including VEGF and fibroblast growth factor-2, are mainly expressed by non-endothelial cell types such as fibroblasts. In contrast, EGFL7 is unique because it is almost exclusively expressed by and acts on endothelial cells. Egfl7 expression is highest when the endothelium is in an active, proliferating state. This factor acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and binds to components of the extracellular matrix. In vivo, Egfl7 is important for regulating tubulogenesis in zebrafish and for controlling vascular patterning and integrity in mice. Its function in blood vessel development is mediated, at least in part, through modulation of Notch signaling. In this review, we summarize the findings that support a role for Egfl7 in developmental and postnatal angiogenesis and describe the EGFL7-signaling pathways that underlie these processes. In addition, we discuss a potential role for EGFL7 in vascular repair and its possible use as a therapeutic target for treatment of hypoxia-induced injury. Finally, we consider EGFL7 action during tumorigenesis and its potential as an antiangiogenic agent.\n",

      "Epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein 7 (EGFL7), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family, is a potent angiogenic factor expressed in many different cell types. EGFL7 plays a vital role in controlling vascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the main signaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulating evidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has been frequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma, colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression of miR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role in oncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in both the osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activities via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of its angiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, such as ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.\n",

      "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis and permeability should enable the development of more effective therapies for various diseases, including retinopathy, cancer, and other vascular disorders. We focused on epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) which plays an important role in NOTCH signaling and in the organization of angiogenic sprouts. We developed an EGFL7-knockdown in vitro microvessel model and investigated the effect of EGFL7 at a tissue level. We found EGFL7 knockdown suppressed VEGF-A-induced sprouting angiogenesis accompanied by an overproduction of endothelial filopodia and reduced collagen IV deposition at the basal side of endothelial cells. We also observed impaired barrier function which reflected an inflammatory condition. Furthermore, our results showed that proper formation of adherens junctions and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was disturbed. In conclusion, by using a 3D microvessel model we identified novel roles for EGFL7 in endothelial function during sprouting angiogenesis.\n",

      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "The angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4 and 8 have emerged as key regulators of plasma lipid metabolism by serving as potent inhibitors of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In this review, we provide an integrated picture of the role of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 in lipid metabolism by focusing on their impact on LPL activity and plasma triglyceride clearance during physiological conditions such as fasting, refeeding, exercise and cold exposure.\n",
      "Upon refeeding, circulating ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 promote the replenishment of white adipose tissue depots by specifically inhibiting LPL activity in oxidative tissues. During exercise and cold exposure, ANGPTL4 represses local LPL activity to assure that plasma triglycerides are specifically shuttled to exercising muscle and brown adipose tissue, respectively. Overall, ANGPTL4 is the central component of a fatty acid-driven feedback mechanism that regulates plasma triglyceride hydrolysis and subsequent tissue fatty acid uptake in response to changes in lipid availability and cellular fuel demand.\n",
      "ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 together ensure that triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are adequately distributed during different physiological conditions.

      "Microglia, once viewed as static bystanders with limited homeostatic functions, are now considered key players in the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial activation is a salient feature of neuroinflammation involving a dynamic process that generates multitudinous microglial phenotypes that can respond to a variety of situational cues in the central nervous system. Recently, a flurry of single cell RNA-sequencing studies have defined microglial phenotypes in unprecedented detail, and have highlighted robust changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Increased expression of genes such as Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) in microglia during development, damage, and disease, suggest that increased lipid metabolism is needed to fuel protective cellular functions such as phagocytosis. This review describes our current understanding of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in microglia, and highlights microglial lipid metabolism as a modifiable target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "A major step in energy metabolism is hydrolysis of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) to release fatty acids that can be used or stored. This is accomplished by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at 'binding lipolysis sites' at the vascular endothelium. A multitude of interactions are involved in this seemingly simple reaction. Recent advances in the understanding of some of these factors will be discussed in an attempt to build a comprehensive picture.\n",
      "The first event in catabolism of TRLs is that they dock at the vascular endothelium. This requires LPL and GPIHBP1, the endothelial transporter of LPL.Kinetic studies in rats with labeled chylomicrons showed that once a chylomicron has docked in the heart it stays for minutes and a large number of triacylglycerol molecules are split. The distribution of binding between tissues reflects the amount of LPL, as evident from studies with mutant mice.Clearance of TRLs is often slowed down in metabolic disease, as was demonstrated both in mice and men. In mice, this was directly connected to decreased amounts of endothelial LPL.\n",

      "The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is the founding member of a family of seven structurally closely related transmembrane proteins (LRP1, LRP1b, megalin/LRP2, LDL receptor, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, MEGF7/LRP4, LRP8/apolipoprotein E receptor2). These proteins participate in a wide range of physiological processes, including the regulation of lipid metabolism, protection against atherosclerosis, neurodevelopment, and transport of nutrients and vitamins. While currently available data suggest that the role of the LDL receptor is limited to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles, there is growing experimental evidence that the other members of the gene family have additional physiological functions as signal transducers. In this review, we focus on the latest discovered functions of two major members of this family, LRP1 and megalin/LRP2, and on the newly elucidated physiological role of a third member of the family, MEGF7/LRP4, which can also function as a modulator of diverse signaling pathways during development.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized with progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature that occurs prior to neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction. Mounting evidence suggests that aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau leads to synaptic deficits and neurodegeneration, thereby to memory loss. Among the established genetic risk factors for AD, the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor. We and others previously demonstrated that apoE regulates Aβ aggregation and clearance in an isoform-dependent manner. While the effect of apoE on Aβ may explain how apoE isoforms differentially affect AD pathogenesis, there are also other underexplored pathogenic mechanisms. They include differential effects of apoE on cerebral energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, neurovascular function, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. ApoE is a major carrier of cholesterols that are required for neuronal activity and injury repair in the brain. Although there are a few conflicting findings and the underlying mechanism is still unclear, several lines of studies demonstrated that apoE4 leads to synaptic deficits and impairment in long-term potentiation, memory and cognition. In this review, we summarize current understanding of apoE function in the brain, with a particular emphasis on its role in synaptic plasticity and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, involving low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), syndecan, and LRP8/ApoER2.\n",

      "The LDL receptor gene family constitutes a class of structurally closely related cell surface receptors fulfilling diverse functions in different organs, tissues, and cell types. The LDL receptor is the prototype of this family, which also includes the VLDLR, ApoER2/LRP8, LRP1 and LRP1B, as well as Megalin/GP330, SorLA/LR11, LRP5, LRP6 and MEGF7. Recently several lines of evidence have positioned the LDL receptor gene family as one of the key players in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Initially this receptor family was of high interest due to its key function in cholesterol/apolipoprotein E (ApoE) uptake, with the epsilon4 allele of ApoE as the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. It has been established that the cholesterol metabolism of the cell has a strong impact on the production of Abeta, the major component of the plaques found in the brain of AD-patients. The original report that soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing the kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain might act as a ligand for LRP1 led to a complex investigation of the interaction of both proteins and their potential function in AD development. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that LRP1 might bind to APP independent of the KPI domain in APP. This APP - LRP1 interaction is facilitated through a trimeric complex of APP-FE65-LRP1, which has a functional role in APP processing. Along with LRP1, APP is transported from the early secretory compartments to the cell surface and subsequently internalised into the endosomal / lysosomal compartments. Recent investigations indicate that ApoER2 and SorLA fulfil a similar role in shifting APP localisation in the cell, which affects APP processing and the production of the APP derived amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). In addition to the effect of lipoprotein receptors on APP processing and Abeta production, LRP1 has been shown to bind Abeta directly or indirectly through Abeta-lactoferrin, Abeta-alpha2M and Abeta-ApoE complexes in vitro and in vivo. Based on these observations two LRP1 mediated clearance mechanisms of Abeta are proposed to play a crucial role in the prevention of AD: either Abeta-uptake into a cell with its subsequent degradation or its transport out of the brain over the blood brain barrier into the periphery. Following this export Abeta is degraded in the liver, where LRP1 potentially conducts the removal of Abeta from the blood stream. Although the involvement of LDLR family members in AD is not yet fully understood it becomes clear that they can directly affect APP production, Abeta-clearance and Abeta-transport over the blood brain barrier.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) binds to LDL receptor (LDLR) and targets it for lysosomal degradation in cells. Decreased hepatic clearance of plasma LDL-cholesterol is the primary gauge of PCSK9 activity in humans; however, PCSK9's evolutionary role may extend to other lipoprotein classes and processes. This review highlights studies that are providing novel insights into physiological regulation of PCSK9 transcription and plasma PCSK9 activity.\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that circulating PCSK9 binds to apolipoprotein B100 on LDL particles, which in turn inhibits PCSK9's ability to bind to cell surface LDLRs. Negative feedback of secreted PCSK9 activity by LDL could serve to increase plasma excursion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and monitor lipoprotein remodeling. Recent findings have identified hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α as a key transcriptional regulator that cooperates with sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 to control PCSK9 expression in hepatocytes in response to nutritional and hormonal inputs, as well as acute inflammation.\n",
      "PCSK9 is an established target for cholesterol-lowering therapies. Further study of PCSK9 regulatory mechanisms may identify additional control points for pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. PCSK9 function could reflect ancient roles in the fasting-feeding cycle and in linking lipoprotein metabolism with innate immunity.\n",

LDL-C, one of the risk factors in cardiovascular disease, is cleared through endocytosis recycling of LDLR. Therefore, we propose that a balance between LDLR endocytosis recycling and PCSK9-mediated and IDOL-mediated lysosomal LDLR degradation is responsible for cholesterol homeostasis in the ER.

      "Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting diet-induced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b(+/+) and Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, PPAR-delta, PPAR-gamma, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Excessive absorption of products of dietary fat digestion leads to type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related disorders. Mice deficient in the group 1B phospholipase A₂ (Pla2g1b), a gut digestive enzyme, are protected against diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes without displaying dietary lipid malabsorption. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Pla2g1b protects against diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Results showed that the Pla2g1b(-/-) mice had decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice subsequent to feeding a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (hypercaloric) diet. These differences were evident before differences in body weight gains were observed. Injection of Poloxamer 407 to inhibit lipolysis revealed decreased VLDL production in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. Supplementation with lysophosphatidylcholine, the product of Pla2g1b hydrolysis, restored VLDL production rates in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice and further elevated VLDL production in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed decreased postprandial lipidemia compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. These results show that, in addition to dietary fatty acids, gut-derived lysophospholipids derived from Pla2g1b hydrolysis of dietary and biliary phospholipids also promote hepatic VLDL production. Thus, the inhibition of lysophospholipid absorption via Pla2g1b inactivation may prove beneficial against diet-induced hyperlipidemia in addition to the protection against obesity and diabetes.\n",

      "Immunity to intestinal helminth infections has been well studied, but the mechanism of helminth killing prior to expulsion remains unclear. Here we identify epithelial-cell-derived phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> group 1B (PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B) as a host-derived endogenous anthelmintic. PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B is elevated in resistant mice and is responsible for killing tissue-embedded larvae. Despite comparable activities of other essential type-2-dependent immune mechanisms, Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to expel the intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Expression of Pla2g1b by epithelial cells was dependent upon intestinal microbiota, adaptive immunity, and common-gamma chain-dependent signaling. Notably, Pla2g1b was downregulated in susceptible mice and inhibited by IL-4R-signaling in vitro, uncoupling parasite killing from expulsion mechanisms. Resistance was restored in Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice by treating infective H. polygyrus L3 larvae with PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B, which reduced larval phospholipid abundance. These findings uncover epithelial-cell-derived Pla2g1b as an essential mediator of helminth killing, highlighting a previously overlooked mechanism of anti-helminth immunity.\n",

      "Reelin is a glycoprotein that serves important roles both during development (regulation of neuronal migration and brain lamination) and in adulthood (maintenance of synaptic function). A number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Alzheimer's disease and lissencephaly share a common feature of abnormal Reelin expression in the brain. Altered Reelin expression has been hypothesized to impair neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity, leading ultimately to the cognitive deficits present in these disorders. The mechanisms for abnormal Reelin expression in some of these disorders are currently unknown although possible explanations include early developmental insults, mutations, hypermethylation of the promoter for the Reelin gene (RELN), miRNA silencing of Reelin mRNA, FMRP underexpression and Reelin processing abnormalities. Increasing Reelin expression through pharmacological therapies may help ameliorate symptoms resulting from Reelin deficits.

      "Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a major cause of developmental disabilities, severe epilepsy, and reproductive disadvantage. Genes that have been associated to MCD are mainly involved in cell proliferation and specification, neuronal migration, and late cortical organization. Lissencephaly-pachygyria-severe band heterotopia are diffuse neuronal migration disorders causing severe global neurological impairment. Abnormalities of the <i>LIS1, DCX, ARX</i>, <i>RELN</i>, <i>VLDLR</i>, <i>ACTB</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>TUBG1</i>, <i>KIF5C</i>, <i>KIF2A</i>, and <i>CDK5</i> genes have been associated with these malformations. More recent studies have also established a relationship between lissencephaly, with or without associated microcephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis as well as cerebellar hypoplasia, and at times, a morphological pattern consistent with polymicrogyria with mutations of several genes <i>(TUBA1A</i>, <i>TUBA8</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, <i>TUBB2B</i>, <i>TUBB3</i>, and <i>DYNC1H1)</i>, regulating the synthesis and function of microtubule and centrosome key components and hence defined as tubulinopathies. MCD only affecting subsets of neurons, such as mild subcortical band heterotopia and periventricular heterotopia, have been associated with abnormalities of the <i>DCX</i>, <i>FLN1A</i>, and <i>ARFGEF2</i> genes and cause neurological and cognitive impairment that vary from severe to mild deficits. Polymicrogyria results from abnormal late cortical organization and is inconstantly associated with abnormal neuronal migration. Localized polymicrogyria has been associated with anatomo-specific deficits, including disorders of language and higher cognition. Polymicrogyria is genetically heterogeneous, and only in a small minority of patients, a definite genetic cause has been identified. Megalencephaly with normal cortex or polymicrogyria by MRI imaging, hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia can all result from mutations in genes of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Postzygotic mutations have been described for most MCD and can be limited to the dysplastic tissue in the less diffuse forms.\n",

Emerging technologies to analyze the entire genome in large data sets have also revealed coding variants that increase AD risk: PLD3 and TREM2. We review the relationship between these AD risk genes and the cellular and neuropathologic features of AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, classified as either early onset (under 65 years of age), or late onset (over 65 years of age). Three main genes are involved in early onset AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele has been found to be a main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes that might be potential risk factors for AD, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Recent studies have discovered additional novel genes that might be involved in late-onset AD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). Identification of new AD-related genes is important for better understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Since the differential diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders are difficult, especially in the early stages, genetic testing is essential for diagnostic processes. Next-generation sequencing studies have been successfully used for detecting mutations, monitoring the epigenetic changes, and analyzing transcriptomes. These studies may be a promising approach toward understanding the complete genetic mechanisms of diverse genetic disorders such as AD.\n",

      "Whether cholesterol is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still controversial. Several studies that explored the association between lipids and/or lipid-lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ, CLU), ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7(ABCA7), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Functional cell biology studies further support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of Aβ precursor protein processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase resulting in altered Aβ production. However, conflicting evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk, randomized clinical trials observing no beneficial effect of statin therapy, and cell biology studies suggesting that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol level is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits colocalization of β-secretase 1 and Aβ precursor protein in nonraft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an Aβ-degrading enzyme. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the findings of epidemiological, genetic, and cell biology studies aiming to elucidate the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "Reelin is a large secreted glycoprotein that is essential for correct neuronal positioning during neurodevelopment and is important for synaptic plasticity in the mature brain. Moreover, Reelin is expressed in many extraneuronal tissues; yet the roles of peripheral Reelin are largely unknown. In the brain, many of Reelin's functions are mediated by a molecular signaling cascade that involves two lipoprotein receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (Apoer2) and very low density-lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr), the neuronal phosphoprotein Disabled-1 (Dab1), and members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases as crucial elements. This core signaling pathway in turn modulates the activity of adaptor proteins and downstream protein kinase cascades, many of which target the neuronal cytoskeleton. However, additional Reelin-binding receptors have been postulated or described, either as coreceptors that are essential for the activation of the \"canonical\" Reelin signaling cascade involving Apoer2/Vldlr and Dab1, or as receptors that activate alternative or additional signaling pathways. Here we will give an overview of canonical and alternative Reelin signaling pathways, molecular mechanisms involved, and their potential physiological roles in the context of different biological settings.\n",

Surprisingly, it was discovered that two LDLR family members, ApoE receptor 2 (Apoer2) and VLDL receptor (Vldlr), play key roles in brain development and adult synaptic plasticity, primarily by mediating Reelin signaling.

      "The salivary α-amylase is a calcium-binding enzyme that initiates starch digestion in the oral cavity. The α-amylase genes are located in a cluster on the chromosome that includes salivary amylase genes (AMY1), two pancreatic α-amylase genes (AMY2A and AMY2B) and a related pseudogene. The AMY1 genes show extensive copy number variation which is directly proportional to the salivary α-amylase content in saliva. The α-amylase amount in saliva is also influenced by other factors, such as hydration status, psychosocial stress level, and short-term dietary habits. It has been shown that the average copy number of AMY1 gene is higher in populations that evolved under high-starch diets versus low-starch diets, reflecting an intense positive selection imposed by diet on amylase copy number during evolution. In this context, a number of different aspects can be considered in evaluating the possible impact of copy number variation of the AMY1 gene on nutrition research, such as issues related to human diet gene evolution, action on starch digestion, effect on glycemic response after starch consumption, modulation of the action of α-amylases inhibitors, effect on taste perception and satiety, influence on psychosocial stress and relation to oral health.\n",

      "High amylase activity in dogs is associated with a drastic increase in copy numbers of the gene coding for pancreatic amylase, AMY2B, that likely allowed dogs to thrive on a relatively starch-rich diet during early dog domestication. Although most dogs thus probably digest starch more efficiently than do wolves, AMY2B copy numbers vary widely within the dog population, and it is not clear how this variation affects the individual ability to handle starch nor how it affects dog health. In humans, copy numbers of the gene coding for salivary amylase, AMY1, correlate with both salivary amylase levels and enzyme activity, and high amylase activity is related to improved glycemic homeostasis and lower frequencies of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigate the relationship between AMY2B copy numbers and serum amylase activity in dogs and show that amylase activity correlates with AMY2B copy numbers. We then describe how AMY2B copy numbers vary in individuals from 20 dog breeds and find strong breed-dependent patterns, indicating that the ability to digest starch varies both at the breed and individual level. Finally, to test whether AMY2B copy number is strongly associated with the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, we compare copy numbers in cases and controls as well as in breeds with varying diabetes susceptibility. Although we see no such association here, future studies using larger cohorts are needed before excluding a possible link between AMY2B and diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Prolonged human interactions and artificial selection have influenced the genotypic and phenotypic diversity among dog breeds. Because humans and dogs occupy diverse habitats, ecological contexts have likely contributed to breed-specific positive selection. Prior to the advent of modern dog-feeding practices, there was likely substantial variation in dietary landscapes among disparate dog breeds. As such, we investigated one type of genetic variant, copy number variation, in three metabolic genes: glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), phytanol-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH), and pancreatic α-amylase 2B (AMY2B). These genes code for proteins that are responsible for metabolizing dietary products that originate from distinctly different food types: sugar, meat, and starch, respectively. After surveying copy number variation among dogs with diverse dietary histories, we found no correlation between diet and positive selection in either GCKR or PHYH. Although it has been previously demonstrated that dogs experienced a copy number increase in AMY2B relative to wolves during or after the dog domestication process, we demonstrate that positive selection continued to act on amylase copy number in dog breeds that consumed starch-rich diets in time periods after domestication. Furthermore, we found that introgression with wolves is not responsible for deterioration of positive selection on AMY2B among diverse dog breeds. Together, this supports the hypothesis that the amylase copy number expansion is found universally in dogs.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent, and physical exercise represents one of the most effective methods to attenuate NAFLD. However, the mechanism of aerobic exercise improving NAFLD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on CNPY2-PERK pathway in mice with NAFLD. Our study found that a high-fat diet induced NAFLD, causing an abnormal lipid metabolism and liver function injury, and increased the expressions of CNPY2, CNPY2 mRNA, PERK, PERK mRNA, p-eIF2a and CHOP. However, aerobic exercise reversesd all these parameters. These data suggest that CNPY2-PERK pathway is involved in the formation of NAFLD, and aerobic exercise can effectively improve NAFLD, which may be related to down-regulate the protein expressions of the CNPY2-PERK pathway.\n",

      "EGFL7 is a secreted angiogenic factor that is highly conserved in vertebrates. Most secreted angiogenic signaling molecules, including VEGF and fibroblast growth factor-2, are mainly expressed by non-endothelial cell types such as fibroblasts. In contrast, EGFL7 is unique because it is almost exclusively expressed by and acts on endothelial cells. Egfl7 expression is highest when the endothelium is in an active, proliferating state. This factor acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and binds to components of the extracellular matrix. In vivo, Egfl7 is important for regulating tubulogenesis in zebrafish and for controlling vascular patterning and integrity in mice. Its function in blood vessel development is mediated, at least in part, through modulation of Notch signaling. In this review, we summarize the findings that support a role for Egfl7 in developmental and postnatal angiogenesis and describe the EGFL7-signaling pathways that underlie these processes. In addition, we discuss a potential role for EGFL7 in vascular repair and its possible use as a therapeutic target for treatment of hypoxia-induced injury. Finally, we consider EGFL7 action during tumorigenesis and its potential as an antiangiogenic agent.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein 7 (EGFL7), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family, is a potent angiogenic factor expressed in many different cell types. EGFL7 plays a vital role in controlling vascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the main signaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulating evidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has been frequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma, colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression of miR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role in oncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in both the osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activities via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of its angiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, such as ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.\n",

      "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis and permeability should enable the development of more effective therapies for various diseases, including retinopathy, cancer, and other vascular disorders. We focused on epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) which plays an important role in NOTCH signaling and in the organization of angiogenic sprouts. We developed an EGFL7-knockdown in vitro microvessel model and investigated the effect of EGFL7 at a tissue level. We found EGFL7 knockdown suppressed VEGF-A-induced sprouting angiogenesis accompanied by an overproduction of endothelial filopodia and reduced collagen IV deposition at the basal side of endothelial cells. We also observed impaired barrier function which reflected an inflammatory condition. Furthermore, our results showed that proper formation of adherens junctions and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was disturbed. In conclusion, by using a 3D microvessel model we identified novel roles for EGFL7 in endothelial function during sprouting angiogenesis.\n",

      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "The angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4 and 8 have emerged as key regulators of plasma lipid metabolism by serving as potent inhibitors of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In this review, we provide an integrated picture of the role of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 in lipid metabolism by focusing on their impact on LPL activity and plasma triglyceride clearance during physiological conditions such as fasting, refeeding, exercise and cold exposure.\n",
      "Upon refeeding, circulating ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 promote the replenishment of white adipose tissue depots by specifically inhibiting LPL activity in oxidative tissues. During exercise and cold exposure, ANGPTL4 represses local LPL activity to assure that plasma triglycerides are specifically shuttled to exercising muscle and brown adipose tissue, respectively. Overall, ANGPTL4 is the central component of a fatty acid-driven feedback mechanism that regulates plasma triglyceride hydrolysis and subsequent tissue fatty acid uptake in response to changes in lipid availability and cellular fuel demand.\n",
      "ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 together ensure that triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are adequately distributed during different physiological conditions. The impact of the ANGPTLs on plasma lipid levels has led to scrutiny of ANGPTLs as therapeutic targets for dyslipidemia.\n",

      "Microglia, once viewed as static bystanders with limited homeostatic functions, are now considered key players in the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial activation is a salient feature of neuroinflammation involving a dynamic process that generates multitudinous microglial phenotypes that can respond to a variety of situational cues in the central nervous system. Recently, a flurry of single cell RNA-sequencing studies have defined microglial phenotypes in unprecedented detail, and have highlighted robust changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Increased expression of genes such as Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) in microglia during development, damage, and disease, suggest that increased lipid metabolism is needed to fuel protective cellular functions such as phagocytosis. This review describes our current understanding of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in microglia, and highlights microglial lipid metabolism as a modifiable target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "A major step in energy metabolism is hydrolysis of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) to release fatty acids that can be used or stored. This is accomplished by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at 'binding lipolysis sites' at the vascular endothelium. A multitude of interactions are involved in this seemingly simple reaction. Recent advances in the understanding of some of these factors will be discussed in an attempt to build a comprehensive picture.\n",
      "The first event in catabolism of TRLs is that they dock at the vascular endothelium. This requires LPL and GPIHBP1, the endothelial transporter of LPL.Kinetic studies in rats with labeled chylomicrons showed that once a chylomicron has docked in the heart it stays for minutes and a large number of triacylglycerol molecules are split. The distribution of binding between tissues reflects the amount of LPL, as evident from studies with mutant mice.Clearance of TRLs is often slowed down in metabolic disease, as was demonstrated both in mice and men. In mice, this was directly connected to decreased amounts of endothelial LPL.\n",
      "The LPL system is central in energy metabolism and results from interplay between several factors. Rapid and exciting progress is being made.\n",

      "The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is the founding member of a family of seven structurally closely related transmembrane proteins (LRP1, LRP1b, megalin/LRP2, LDL receptor, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, MEGF7/LRP4, LRP8/apolipoprotein E receptor2). These proteins participate in a wide range of physiological processes, including the regulation of lipid metabolism, protection against atherosclerosis, neurodevelopment, and transport of nutrients and vitamins. While currently available data suggest that the role of the LDL receptor is limited to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles, there is growing experimental evidence that the other members of the gene family have additional physiological functions as signal transducers. In this review, we focus on the latest discovered functions of two major members of this family, LRP1 and megalin/LRP2, and on the newly elucidated physiological role of a third member of the family, MEGF7/LRP4, which can also function as a modulator of diverse signaling pathways during development.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized with progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature that occurs prior to neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction. Mounting evidence suggests that aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau leads to synaptic deficits and neurodegeneration, thereby to memory loss. Among the established genetic risk factors for AD, the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor. We and others previously demonstrated that apoE regulates Aβ aggregation and clearance in an isoform-dependent manner. While the effect of apoE on Aβ may explain how apoE isoforms differentially affect AD pathogenesis, there are also other underexplored pathogenic mechanisms. They include differential effects of apoE on cerebral energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, neurovascular function, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. ApoE is a major carrier of cholesterols that are required for neuronal activity and injury repair in the brain. Although there are a few conflicting findings and the underlying mechanism is still unclear, several lines of studies demonstrated that apoE4 leads to synaptic deficits and impairment in long-term potentiation, memory and cognition. In this review, we summarize current understanding of apoE function in the brain, with a particular emphasis on its role in synaptic plasticity and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, involving low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), syndecan, and LRP8/ApoER2.\n",

      "The LDL receptor gene family constitutes a class of structurally closely related cell surface receptors fulfilling diverse functions in different organs, tissues, and cell types. The LDL receptor is the prototype of this family, which also includes the VLDLR, ApoER2/LRP8, LRP1 and LRP1B, as well as Megalin/GP330, SorLA/LR11, LRP5, LRP6 and MEGF7. Recently several lines of evidence have positioned the LDL receptor gene family as one of the key players in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Initially this receptor family was of high interest due to its key function in cholesterol/apolipoprotein E (ApoE) uptake, with the epsilon4 allele of ApoE as the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. It has been established that the cholesterol metabolism of the cell has a strong impact on the production of Abeta, the major component of the plaques found in the brain of AD-patients. The original report that soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing the kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain might act as a ligand for LRP1 led to a complex investigation of the interaction of both proteins and their potential function in AD development. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that LRP1 might bind to APP independent of the KPI domain in APP. This APP - LRP1 interaction is facilitated through a trimeric complex of APP-FE65-LRP1, which has a functional role in APP processing. Along with LRP1, APP is transported from the early secretory compartments to the cell surface and subsequently internalised into the endosomal / lysosomal compartments. Recent investigations indicate that ApoER2 and SorLA fulfil a similar role in shifting APP localisation in the cell, which affects APP processing and the production of the APP derived amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). In addition to the effect of lipoprotein receptors on APP processing and Abeta production, LRP1 has been shown to bind Abeta directly or indirectly through Abeta-lactoferrin, Abeta-alpha2M and Abeta-ApoE complexes in vitro and in vivo. Based on these observations two LRP1 mediated clearance mechanisms of Abeta are proposed to play a crucial role in the prevention of AD: either Abeta-uptake into a cell with its subsequent degradation or its transport out of the brain over the blood brain barrier into the periphery. Following this export Abeta is degraded in the liver, where LRP1 potentially conducts the removal of Abeta from the blood stream. Although the involvement of LDLR family members in AD is not yet fully understood it becomes clear that they can directly affect APP production, Abeta-clearance and Abeta-transport over the blood brain barrier.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) binds to LDL receptor (LDLR) and targets it for lysosomal degradation in cells. Decreased hepatic clearance of plasma LDL-cholesterol is the primary gauge of PCSK9 activity in humans; however, PCSK9's evolutionary role may extend to other lipoprotein classes and processes. This review highlights studies that are providing novel insights into physiological regulation of PCSK9 transcription and plasma PCSK9 activity.\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that circulating PCSK9 binds to apolipoprotein B100 on LDL particles, which in turn inhibits PCSK9's ability to bind to cell surface LDLRs. Negative feedback of secreted PCSK9 activity by LDL could serve to increase plasma excursion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and monitor lipoprotein remodeling. Recent findings have identified hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α as a key transcriptional regulator that cooperates with sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 to control PCSK9 expression in hepatocytes in response to nutritional and hormonal inputs, as well as acute inflammation.\n",
      "PCSK9 is an established target for cholesterol-lowering therapies. Further study of PCSK9 regulatory mechanisms may identify additional control points for pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. PCSK9 function could reflect ancient roles in the fasting-feeding cycle and in linking lipoprotein metabolism with innate immunity.\n",

      "The SREBP2/LDLR pathway is sensitive to cholesterol content in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while membrane low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is influenced by sterol response element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL). LDL-C, one of the risk factors in cardiovascular disease, is cleared through endocytosis recycling of LDLR. Therefore, we propose that a balance between LDLR endocytosis recycling and PCSK9-mediated and IDOL-mediated lysosomal LDLR degradation is responsible for cholesterol homeostasis in the ER. For statins that decrease serum LDL-C levels via cholesterol synthesis inhibition, the mechanism by which the statins increase the membrane LDLR may be regulated by cholesterol homeostasis in the ER.\n",

      "Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting diet-induced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b(+/+) and Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, PPAR-delta, PPAR-gamma, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Excessive absorption of products of dietary fat digestion leads to type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related disorders. Mice deficient in the group 1B phospholipase A₂ (Pla2g1b), a gut digestive enzyme, are protected against diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes without displaying dietary lipid malabsorption. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Pla2g1b protects against diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Results showed that the Pla2g1b(-/-) mice had decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice subsequent to feeding a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (hypercaloric) diet. These differences were evident before differences in body weight gains were observed. Injection of Poloxamer 407 to inhibit lipolysis revealed decreased VLDL production in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. Supplementation with lysophosphatidylcholine, the product of Pla2g1b hydrolysis, restored VLDL production rates in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice and further elevated VLDL production in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed decreased postprandial lipidemia compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. These results show that, in addition to dietary fatty acids, gut-derived lysophospholipids derived from Pla2g1b hydrolysis of dietary and biliary phospholipids also promote hepatic VLDL production. Thus, the inhibition of lysophospholipid absorption via Pla2g1b inactivation may prove beneficial against diet-induced hyperlipidemia in addition to the protection against obesity and diabetes.\n",

      "Immunity to intestinal helminth infections has been well studied, but the mechanism of helminth killing prior to expulsion remains unclear. Here we identify epithelial-cell-derived phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> group 1B (PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B) as a host-derived endogenous anthelmintic. PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B is elevated in resistant mice and is responsible for killing tissue-embedded larvae. Despite comparable activities of other essential type-2-dependent immune mechanisms, Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to expel the intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Expression of Pla2g1b by epithelial cells was dependent upon intestinal microbiota, adaptive immunity, and common-gamma chain-dependent signaling. Notably, Pla2g1b was downregulated in susceptible mice and inhibited by IL-4R-signaling in vitro, uncoupling parasite killing from expulsion mechanisms. Resistance was restored in Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice by treating infective H. polygyrus L3 larvae with PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B, which reduced larval phospholipid abundance. These findings uncover epithelial-cell-derived Pla2g1b as an essential mediator of helminth killing, highlighting a previously overlooked mechanism of anti-helminth immunity.\n",

      "Reelin is a glycoprotein that serves important roles both during development (regulation of neuronal migration and brain lamination) and in adulthood (maintenance of synaptic function). A number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Alzheimer's disease and lissencephaly share a common feature of abnormal Reelin expression in the brain. Altered Reelin expression has been hypothesized to impair neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity, leading ultimately to the cognitive deficits present in these disorders. The mechanisms for abnormal Reelin expression in some of these disorders are currently unknown although possible explanations include early developmental insults, mutations, hypermethylation of the promoter for the Reelin gene (RELN), miRNA silencing of Reelin mRNA, FMRP underexpression and Reelin processing abnormalities. Increasing Reelin expression through pharmacological therapies may help ameliorate symptoms resulting from Reelin deficits.

      "Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a major cause of developmental disabilities, severe epilepsy, and reproductive disadvantage. Genes that have been associated to MCD are mainly involved in cell proliferation and specification, neuronal migration, and late cortical organization. Lissencephaly-pachygyria-severe band heterotopia are diffuse neuronal migration disorders causing severe global neurological impairment. Abnormalities of the <i>LIS1, DCX, ARX</i>, <i>RELN</i>, <i>VLDLR</i>, <i>ACTB</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>TUBG1</i>, <i>KIF5C</i>, <i>KIF2A</i>, and <i>CDK5</i> genes have been associated with these malformations. More recent studies have also established a relationship between lissencephaly, with or without associated microcephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis as well as cerebellar hypoplasia, and at times, a morphological pattern consistent with polymicrogyria with mutations of several genes <i>(TUBA1A</i>, <i>TUBA8</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, <i>TUBB2B</i>, <i>TUBB3</i>, and <i>DYNC1H1)</i>, regulating the synthesis and function of microtubule and centrosome key components and hence defined as tubulinopathies. MCD only affecting subsets of neurons, such as mild subcortical band heterotopia and periventricular heterotopia, have been associated with abnormalities of the <i>DCX</i>, <i>FLN1A</i>, and <i>ARFGEF2</i> genes and cause neurological and cognitive impairment that vary from severe to mild deficits. Polymicrogyria results from abnormal late cortical organization and is inconstantly associated with abnormal neuronal migration. Localized polymicrogyria has been associated with anatomo-specific deficits, including disorders of language and higher cognition. Polymicrogyria is genetically heterogeneous, and only in a small minority of patients, a definite genetic cause has been identified. Megalencephaly with normal cortex or polymicrogyria by MRI imaging, hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia can all result from mutations in genes of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Postzygotic mutations have been described for most MCD and can be limited to the dysplastic tissue in the less diffuse forms.\n",

      "Proper neuronal migration and laminar formation during corticogenesis is essential for normal brain function. Disruption of these developmental processes is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of some neuropsychiatric conditions. Especially, Reelin, a glycoprotein mainly secreted by the Cajal-Retzius cells and a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons, has been shown to play a critical role, both during embryonic and postnatal periods. Indeed, animal studies have clearly revealed that Reelin is an essential molecule for proper migration of cortical neurons and finally regulates the cell positioning in the cortex during embryonic and early postnatal stages; by contrast, Reelin signaling is closely involved in synaptic function in adulthood. In humans, genetic studies have shown that the <i>reelin</i> gene (<i>RELN</i>) is associated with a number of psychiatric diseases, including Schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BP) and autistic spectrum disorder. Indeed, <i>Reln</i> haploinsufficiency has been shown to cause cognitive impairment in rodents, suggesting the expression level of the Reelin protein is closely related to the higher brain functions. However, the molecular abnormalities in the Reelin pathway involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders are not yet fully understood. In this article, we review the current progress in the understanding of the Reelin functions that could be related to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, we discuss the basis for selecting Reelin and molecules in its downstream signaling pathway as potential therapeutic targets for psychiatric illnesses.\n",

      "We review the genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their role in AD pathogenesis. More recent advances in understanding of the human genome-technologic advances in methods to analyze millions of polymorphisms in thousands of subjects-have revealed new genes associated with AD risk, including ABCA7, BIN1, CASS4, CD33, CD2AP, CELF1, CLU, CR1, DSG2, EPHA1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5-DBR1, INPP5D, MS4A, MEF2C, NME8, PICALM, PTK2B, SLC24H4-RIN3, SORL1, and ZCWPW1. Emerging technologies to analyze the entire genome in large data sets have also revealed coding variants that increase AD risk: PLD3 and TREM2. We review the relationship between these AD risk genes and the cellular and neuropathologic features of AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, classified as either early onset (under 65 years of age), or late onset (over 65 years of age). Three main genes are involved in early onset AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele has been found to be a main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes that might be potential risk factors for AD, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Recent studies have discovered additional novel genes that might be involved in late-onset AD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). Identification of new AD-related genes is important for better understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Since the differential diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders are difficult, especially in the early stages, genetic testing is essential for diagnostic processes. Next-generation sequencing studies have been successfully used for detecting mutations, monitoring the epigenetic changes, and analyzing transcriptomes. These studies may be a promising approach toward understanding the complete genetic mechanisms of diverse genetic disorders such as AD.\n",

      "Whether cholesterol is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still controversial. Several studies that explored the association between lipids and/or lipid-lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ, CLU), ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7(ABCA7), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Functional cell biology studies further support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of Aβ precursor protein processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase resulting in altered Aβ production. However, conflicting evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk, randomized clinical trials observing no beneficial effect of statin therapy, and cell biology studies suggesting that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol level is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits colocalization of β-secretase 1 and Aβ precursor protein in nonraft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an Aβ-degrading enzyme. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the findings of epidemiological, genetic, and cell biology studies aiming to elucidate the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD.\n",

      "Reelin is a large secreted glycoprotein that is essential for correct neuronal positioning during neurodevelopment and is important for synaptic plasticity in the mature brain. Moreover, Reelin is expressed in many extraneuronal tissues; yet the roles of peripheral Reelin are largely unknown. In the brain, many of Reelin's functions are mediated by a molecular signaling cascade that involves two lipoprotein receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (Apoer2) and very low density-lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr), the neuronal phosphoprotein Disabled-1 (Dab1), and members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases as crucial elements. This core signaling pathway in turn modulates the activity of adaptor proteins and downstream protein kinase cascades, many of which target the neuronal cytoskeleton. However, additional Reelin-binding receptors have been postulated or described, either as coreceptors that are essential for the activation of the \"canonical\" Reelin signaling cascade involving Apoer2/Vldlr and Dab1, or as receptors that activate alternative or additional signaling pathways. Here we will give an overview of canonical and alternative Reelin signaling pathways, molecular mechanisms involved, and their potential physiological roles in the context of different biological settings.\n",

Surprisingly, it was discovered that two LDLR family members, ApoE receptor 2 (Apoer2) and VLDL receptor (Vldlr), play key roles in brain development and adult synaptic plasticity, primarily by mediating Reelin signaling. This review focuses on Apoer2 and Vldlr signaling in the CNS and its role in human disease.\n",

      "Embraced with apolipoproteins (Apo) B and Apo E, triglyceride-enriched very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is secreted by the liver into circulation, mainly during post-meal hours. Here, we present a brief review of the physiological role of VLDL and a systemic review of the emerging evidence supporting its pathological roles. VLDL promotes atherosclerosis in metabolic syndrome (MetS). VLDL isolated from subjects with MetS exhibits cytotoxicity to atrial myocytes, induces atrial myopathy, and promotes vulnerability to atrial fibrillation. VLDL levels are affected by a number of endocrinological disorders and can be increased by therapeutic supplementation with cortisol, growth hormone, progesterone, and estrogen. VLDL promotes aldosterone secretion, which contributes to hypertension. VLDL induces neuroinflammation, leading to cognitive dysfunction. VLDL levels are also correlated with chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disorders, and some dermatological diseases. The extra-hepatic secretion of VLDL derived from intestinal dysbiosis is suggested to be harmful. Emerging evidence suggests disturbed VLDL metabolism in sleep disorders and in cancer development and progression. In addition to VLDL, the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) may affect both VLDL metabolism and carcinogenesis. Overall, emerging evidence supports the pathological roles of VLDL in multi-organ diseases. To better understand the fundamental mechanisms of how VLDL promotes disease development, elucidation of the quality control of VLDL and of the regulation and signaling of VLDLR should be indispensable. With this, successful VLDL-targeted therapies can be discovered in the future.\n",

      "High amylase activity in dogs is associated with a drastic increase in copy numbers of the gene coding for pancreatic amylase, AMY2B, that likely allowed dogs to thrive on a relatively starch-rich diet during early dog domestication. Although most dogs thus probably digest starch more efficiently than do wolves, AMY2B copy numbers vary widely within the dog population, and it is not clear how this variation affects the individual ability to handle starch nor how it affects dog health. In humans, copy numbers of the gene coding for salivary amylase, AMY1, correlate with both salivary amylase levels and enzyme activity, and high amylase activity is related to improved glycemic homeostasis and lower frequencies of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigate the relationship between AMY2B copy numbers and serum amylase activity in dogs and show that amylase activity correlates with AMY2B copy numbers. We then describe how AMY2B copy numbers vary in individuals from 20 dog breeds and find strong breed-dependent patterns, indicating that the ability to digest starch varies both at the breed and individual level. Finally, to test whether AMY2B copy number is strongly associated with the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, we compare copy numbers in cases and controls as well as in breeds with varying diabetes susceptibility. Although we see no such association here, future studies using larger cohorts are needed before excluding a possible link between AMY2B and diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Prolonged human interactions and artificial selection have influenced the genotypic and phenotypic diversity among dog breeds. Because humans and dogs occupy diverse habitats, ecological contexts have likely contributed to breed-specific positive selection. Prior to the advent of modern dog-feeding practices, there was likely substantial variation in dietary landscapes among disparate dog breeds. As such, we investigated one type of genetic variant, copy number variation, in three metabolic genes: glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), phytanol-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH), and pancreatic α-amylase 2B (AMY2B). These genes code for proteins that are responsible for metabolizing dietary products that originate from distinctly different food types: sugar, meat, and starch, respectively. After surveying copy number variation among dogs with diverse dietary histories, we found no correlation between diet and positive selection in either GCKR or PHYH. Although it has been previously demonstrated that dogs experienced a copy number increase in AMY2B relative to wolves during or after the dog domestication process, we demonstrate that positive selection continued to act on amylase copy number in dog breeds that consumed starch-rich diets in time periods after domestication. Furthermore, we found that introgression with wolves is not responsible for deterioration of positive selection on AMY2B among diverse dog breeds. Together, this supports the hypothesis that the amylase copy number expansion is found universally in dogs.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

However, the mechanism of aerobic exercise improving NAFLD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on CNPY2-PERK pathway in mice with NAFLD. Our study found that a high-fat diet induced NAFLD, causing an abnormal lipid metabolism and liver function injury, and increased the expressions of CNPY2, CNPY2 mRNA, PERK, PERK mRNA, p-eIF2a and CHOP. However, aerobic exercise reversesd all these parameters. These data suggest that CNPY2-PERK pathway is involved in the formation of NAFLD, and aerobic exercise can effectively improve NAFLD, which may be related to down-regulate the protein expressions of the CNPY2-PERK pathway.\n",

      "EGFL7 is a secreted angiogenic factor that is highly conserved in vertebrates. Most secreted angiogenic signaling molecules, including VEGF and fibroblast growth factor-2, are mainly expressed by non-endothelial cell types such as fibroblasts. In contrast, EGFL7 is unique because it is almost exclusively expressed by and acts on endothelial cells. Egfl7 expression is highest when the endothelium is in an active, proliferating state. This factor acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and binds to components of the extracellular matrix. In vivo, Egfl7 is important for regulating tubulogenesis in zebrafish and for controlling vascular patterning and integrity in mice. Its function in blood vessel development is mediated, at least in part, through modulation of Notch signaling. In this review, we summarize the findings that support a role for Egfl7 in developmental and postnatal angiogenesis and describe the EGFL7-signaling pathways that underlie these processes. In addition, we discuss a potential role for EGFL7 in vascular repair and its possible use as a therapeutic target for treatment of hypoxia-induced injury. Finally, we consider EGFL7 action during tumorigenesis and its potential as an antiangiogenic agent.\n",

      "Epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein 7 (EGFL7), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family, is a potent angiogenic factor expressed in many different cell types. EGFL7 plays a vital role in controlling vascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the main signaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulating evidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has been frequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma, colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression of miR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role in oncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in both the osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activities via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of its angiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, such as ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.\n",

      "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis and permeability should enable the development of more effective therapies for various diseases, including retinopathy, cancer, and other vascular disorders. We focused on epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) which plays an important role in NOTCH signaling and in the organization of angiogenic sprouts. We developed an EGFL7-knockdown in vitro microvessel model and investigated the effect of EGFL7 at a tissue level. We found EGFL7 knockdown suppressed VEGF-A-induced sprouting angiogenesis accompanied by an overproduction of endothelial filopodia and reduced collagen IV deposition at the basal side of endothelial cells. We also observed impaired barrier function which reflected an inflammatory condition. Furthermore, our results showed that proper formation of adherens junctions and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was disturbed. In conclusion, by using a 3D microvessel model we identified novel roles for EGFL7 in endothelial function during sprouting angiogenesis.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "It is now about 20 years since the first case of a gain-of-function mutation involving the as-yet-unknown actor in cholesterol homeostasis, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), was described. It was soon clear that this protein would have been of huge scientific and clinical value as a therapeutic strategy for dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) management. Indeed, PCSK9 is a serine protease belonging to the proprotein convertase family, mainly produced by the liver, and essential for metabolism of LDL particles by inhibiting LDL receptor (LDLR) recirculation to the cell surface with the consequent upregulation of LDLR-dependent LDL-C levels. Beyond its effects on LDL metabolism, several studies revealed the existence of additional roles of PCSK9 in different stages of atherosclerosis, also for its ability to target other members of the LDLR family. PCSK9 from plasma and vascular cells can contribute to the development of atherosclerotic plaque and thrombosis by promoting platelet activation, leukocyte recruitment and clot formation, also through mechanisms not related to systemic lipid changes. These results further supported the value for the potential cardiovascular benefits of therapies based on PCSK9 inhibition. Actually, the passive immunization with anti-PCSK9 antibodies, evolocumab and alirocumab, is shown to be effective in dramatically reducing the LDL-C levels and attenuating CVD. While monoclonal antibodies sequester circulating PCSK9, inclisiran, a small interfering RNA, is a new drug that inhibits PCSK9 synthesis with the important advantage, compared with PCSK9 mAbs, to preserve its pharmacodynamic effects when administrated every 6 months. Here, we will focus on the major understandings related to PCSK9, from its discovery to its role in lipoprotein metabolism, involvement in atherothrombosis and a brief excursus on approved current therapies used to inhibit its action.\n",

      "The angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4 and 8 have emerged as key regulators of plasma lipid metabolism by serving as potent inhibitors of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In this review, we provide an integrated picture of the role of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 in lipid metabolism by focusing on their impact on LPL activity and plasma triglyceride clearance during physiological conditions such as fasting, refeeding, exercise and cold exposure.\n",
      "Upon refeeding, circulating ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 promote the replenishment of white adipose tissue depots by specifically inhibiting LPL activity in oxidative tissues. During exercise and cold exposure, ANGPTL4 represses local LPL activity to assure that plasma triglycerides are specifically shuttled to exercising muscle and brown adipose tissue, respectively. Overall, ANGPTL4 is the central component of a fatty acid-driven feedback mechanism that regulates plasma triglyceride hydrolysis and subsequent tissue fatty acid uptake in response to changes in lipid availability and cellular fuel demand.\n",
      "ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 together ensure that triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are adequately distributed during different physiological conditions.

      "Microglia, once viewed as static bystanders with limited homeostatic functions, are now considered key players in the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial activation is a salient feature of neuroinflammation involving a dynamic process that generates multitudinous microglial phenotypes that can respond to a variety of situational cues in the central nervous system. Recently, a flurry of single cell RNA-sequencing studies have defined microglial phenotypes in unprecedented detail, and have highlighted robust changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Increased expression of genes such as Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) in microglia during development, damage, and disease, suggest that increased lipid metabolism is needed to fuel protective cellular functions such as phagocytosis. This review describes our current understanding of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in microglia, and highlights microglial lipid metabolism as a modifiable target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "A major step in energy metabolism is hydrolysis of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) to release fatty acids that can be used or stored. This is accomplished by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at 'binding lipolysis sites' at the vascular endothelium. A multitude of interactions are involved in this seemingly simple reaction. Recent advances in the understanding of some of these factors will be discussed in an attempt to build a comprehensive picture.\n",
      "The first event in catabolism of TRLs is that they dock at the vascular endothelium. This requires LPL and GPIHBP1, the endothelial transporter of LPL.Kinetic studies in rats with labeled chylomicrons showed that once a chylomicron has docked in the heart it stays for minutes and a large number of triacylglycerol molecules are split. The distribution of binding between tissues reflects the amount of LPL, as evident from studies with mutant mice.Clearance of TRLs is often slowed down in metabolic disease, as was demonstrated both in mice and men. In mice, this was directly connected to decreased amounts of endothelial LPL.\n",

      "The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is the founding member of a family of seven structurally closely related transmembrane proteins (LRP1, LRP1b, megalin/LRP2, LDL receptor, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, MEGF7/LRP4, LRP8/apolipoprotein E receptor2). These proteins participate in a wide range of physiological processes, including the regulation of lipid metabolism, protection against atherosclerosis, neurodevelopment, and transport of nutrients and vitamins. While currently available data suggest that the role of the LDL receptor is limited to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles, there is growing experimental evidence that the other members of the gene family have additional physiological functions as signal transducers. In this review, we focus on the latest discovered functions of two major members of this family, LRP1 and megalin/LRP2, and on the newly elucidated physiological role of a third member of the family, MEGF7/LRP4, which can also function as a modulator of diverse signaling pathways during development.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized with progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature that occurs prior to neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction. Mounting evidence suggests that aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau leads to synaptic deficits and neurodegeneration, thereby to memory loss. Among the established genetic risk factors for AD, the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor. We and others previously demonstrated that apoE regulates Aβ aggregation and clearance in an isoform-dependent manner. While the effect of apoE on Aβ may explain how apoE isoforms differentially affect AD pathogenesis, there are also other underexplored pathogenic mechanisms. They include differential effects of apoE on cerebral energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, neurovascular function, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. ApoE is a major carrier of cholesterols that are required for neuronal activity and injury repair in the brain. Although there are a few conflicting findings and the underlying mechanism is still unclear, several lines of studies demonstrated that apoE4 leads to synaptic deficits and impairment in long-term potentiation, memory and cognition. In this review, we summarize current understanding of apoE function in the brain, with a particular emphasis on its role in synaptic plasticity and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, involving low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), syndecan, and LRP8/ApoER2.\n",

      "The LDL receptor gene family constitutes a class of structurally closely related cell surface receptors fulfilling diverse functions in different organs, tissues, and cell types. The LDL receptor is the prototype of this family, which also includes the VLDLR, ApoER2/LRP8, LRP1 and LRP1B, as well as Megalin/GP330, SorLA/LR11, LRP5, LRP6 and MEGF7. Recently several lines of evidence have positioned the LDL receptor gene family as one of the key players in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Initially this receptor family was of high interest due to its key function in cholesterol/apolipoprotein E (ApoE) uptake, with the epsilon4 allele of ApoE as the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. It has been established that the cholesterol metabolism of the cell has a strong impact on the production of Abeta, the major component of the plaques found in the brain of AD-patients. The original report that soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing the kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain might act as a ligand for LRP1 led to a complex investigation of the interaction of both proteins and their potential function in AD development. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that LRP1 might bind to APP independent of the KPI domain in APP. This APP - LRP1 interaction is facilitated through a trimeric complex of APP-FE65-LRP1, which has a functional role in APP processing. Along with LRP1, APP is transported from the early secretory compartments to the cell surface and subsequently internalised into the endosomal / lysosomal compartments. Recent investigations indicate that ApoER2 and SorLA fulfil a similar role in shifting APP localisation in the cell, which affects APP processing and the production of the APP derived amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). In addition to the effect of lipoprotein receptors on APP processing and Abeta production, LRP1 has been shown to bind Abeta directly or indirectly through Abeta-lactoferrin, Abeta-alpha2M and Abeta-ApoE complexes in vitro and in vivo. Based on these observations two LRP1 mediated clearance mechanisms of Abeta are proposed to play a crucial role in the prevention of AD: either Abeta-uptake into a cell with its subsequent degradation or its transport out of the brain over the blood brain barrier into the periphery. Following this export Abeta is degraded in the liver, where LRP1 potentially conducts the removal of Abeta from the blood stream. Although the involvement of LDLR family members in AD is not yet fully understood it becomes clear that they can directly affect APP production, Abeta-clearance and Abeta-transport over the blood brain barrier.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) binds to LDL receptor (LDLR) and targets it for lysosomal degradation in cells. Decreased hepatic clearance of plasma LDL-cholesterol is the primary gauge of PCSK9 activity in humans; however, PCSK9's evolutionary role may extend to other lipoprotein classes and processes. This review highlights studies that are providing novel insights into physiological regulation of PCSK9 transcription and plasma PCSK9 activity.\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that circulating PCSK9 binds to apolipoprotein B100 on LDL particles, which in turn inhibits PCSK9's ability to bind to cell surface LDLRs. Negative feedback of secreted PCSK9 activity by LDL could serve to increase plasma excursion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and monitor lipoprotein remodeling. Recent findings have identified hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α as a key transcriptional regulator that cooperates with sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 to control PCSK9 expression in hepatocytes in response to nutritional and hormonal inputs, as well as acute inflammation.\n",
      "PCSK9 is an established target for cholesterol-lowering therapies. Further study of PCSK9 regulatory mechanisms may identify additional control points for pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. PCSK9 function could reflect ancient roles in the fasting-feeding cycle and in linking lipoprotein metabolism with innate immunity.\n",

LDL-C, one of the risk factors in cardiovascular disease, is cleared through endocytosis recycling of LDLR. Therefore, we propose that a balance between LDLR endocytosis recycling and PCSK9-mediated and IDOL-mediated lysosomal LDLR degradation is responsible for cholesterol homeostasis in the ER.

      "Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting diet-induced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b(+/+) and Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, PPAR-delta, PPAR-gamma, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Excessive absorption of products of dietary fat digestion leads to type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related disorders. Mice deficient in the group 1B phospholipase A₂ (Pla2g1b), a gut digestive enzyme, are protected against diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes without displaying dietary lipid malabsorption. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Pla2g1b protects against diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Results showed that the Pla2g1b(-/-) mice had decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice subsequent to feeding a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (hypercaloric) diet. These differences were evident before differences in body weight gains were observed. Injection of Poloxamer 407 to inhibit lipolysis revealed decreased VLDL production in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. Supplementation with lysophosphatidylcholine, the product of Pla2g1b hydrolysis, restored VLDL production rates in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice and further elevated VLDL production in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed decreased postprandial lipidemia compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. These results show that, in addition to dietary fatty acids, gut-derived lysophospholipids derived from Pla2g1b hydrolysis of dietary and biliary phospholipids also promote hepatic VLDL production. Thus, the inhibition of lysophospholipid absorption via Pla2g1b inactivation may prove beneficial against diet-induced hyperlipidemia in addition to the protection against obesity and diabetes.\n",

      "Immunity to intestinal helminth infections has been well studied, but the mechanism of helminth killing prior to expulsion remains unclear. Here we identify epithelial-cell-derived phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> group 1B (PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B) as a host-derived endogenous anthelmintic. PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B is elevated in resistant mice and is responsible for killing tissue-embedded larvae. Despite comparable activities of other essential type-2-dependent immune mechanisms, Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to expel the intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Expression of Pla2g1b by epithelial cells was dependent upon intestinal microbiota, adaptive immunity, and common-gamma chain-dependent signaling. Notably, Pla2g1b was downregulated in susceptible mice and inhibited by IL-4R-signaling in vitro, uncoupling parasite killing from expulsion mechanisms. Resistance was restored in Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice by treating infective H. polygyrus L3 larvae with PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B, which reduced larval phospholipid abundance. These findings uncover epithelial-cell-derived Pla2g1b as an essential mediator of helminth killing, highlighting a previously overlooked mechanism of anti-helminth immunity.\n",

      "Reelin is a glycoprotein that serves important roles both during development (regulation of neuronal migration and brain lamination) and in adulthood (maintenance of synaptic function). A number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Alzheimer's disease and lissencephaly share a common feature of abnormal Reelin expression in the brain. Altered Reelin expression has been hypothesized to impair neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity, leading ultimately to the cognitive deficits present in these disorders. The mechanisms for abnormal Reelin expression in some of these disorders are currently unknown although possible explanations include early developmental insults, mutations, hypermethylation of the promoter for the Reelin gene (RELN), miRNA silencing of Reelin mRNA, FMRP underexpression and Reelin processing abnormalities. Increasing Reelin expression through pharmacological therapies may help ameliorate symptoms resulting from Reelin deficits.

      "Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a major cause of developmental disabilities, severe epilepsy, and reproductive disadvantage. Genes that have been associated to MCD are mainly involved in cell proliferation and specification, neuronal migration, and late cortical organization. Lissencephaly-pachygyria-severe band heterotopia are diffuse neuronal migration disorders causing severe global neurological impairment. Abnormalities of the <i>LIS1, DCX, ARX</i>, <i>RELN</i>, <i>VLDLR</i>, <i>ACTB</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>TUBG1</i>, <i>KIF5C</i>, <i>KIF2A</i>, and <i>CDK5</i> genes have been associated with these malformations. More recent studies have also established a relationship between lissencephaly, with or without associated microcephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis as well as cerebellar hypoplasia, and at times, a morphological pattern consistent with polymicrogyria with mutations of several genes <i>(TUBA1A</i>, <i>TUBA8</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, <i>TUBB2B</i>, <i>TUBB3</i>, and <i>DYNC1H1)</i>, regulating the synthesis and function of microtubule and centrosome key components and hence defined as tubulinopathies. MCD only affecting subsets of neurons, such as mild subcortical band heterotopia and periventricular heterotopia, have been associated with abnormalities of the <i>DCX</i>, <i>FLN1A</i>, and <i>ARFGEF2</i> genes and cause neurological and cognitive impairment that vary from severe to mild deficits. Polymicrogyria results from abnormal late cortical organization and is inconstantly associated with abnormal neuronal migration. Localized polymicrogyria has been associated with anatomo-specific deficits, including disorders of language and higher cognition. Polymicrogyria is genetically heterogeneous, and only in a small minority of patients, a definite genetic cause has been identified. Megalencephaly with normal cortex or polymicrogyria by MRI imaging, hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia can all result from mutations in genes of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Postzygotic mutations have been described for most MCD and can be limited to the dysplastic tissue in the less diffuse forms.\n",

Emerging technologies to analyze the entire genome in large data sets have also revealed coding variants that increase AD risk: PLD3 and TREM2. We review the relationship between these AD risk genes and the cellular and neuropathologic features of AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, classified as either early onset (under 65 years of age), or late onset (over 65 years of age). Three main genes are involved in early onset AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele has been found to be a main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes that might be potential risk factors for AD, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Recent studies have discovered additional novel genes that might be involved in late-onset AD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). Identification of new AD-related genes is important for better understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Since the differential diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders are difficult, especially in the early stages, genetic testing is essential for diagnostic processes. Next-generation sequencing studies have been successfully used for detecting mutations, monitoring the epigenetic changes, and analyzing transcriptomes. These studies may be a promising approach toward understanding the complete genetic mechanisms of diverse genetic disorders such as AD.\n",

      "Whether cholesterol is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still controversial. Several studies that explored the association between lipids and/or lipid-lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ, CLU), ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7(ABCA7), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Functional cell biology studies further support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of Aβ precursor protein processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase resulting in altered Aβ production. However, conflicting evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk, randomized clinical trials observing no beneficial effect of statin therapy, and cell biology studies suggesting that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol level is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits colocalization of β-secretase 1 and Aβ precursor protein in nonraft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an Aβ-degrading enzyme. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the findings of epidemiological, genetic, and cell biology studies aiming to elucidate the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "Reelin is a large secreted glycoprotein that is essential for correct neuronal positioning during neurodevelopment and is important for synaptic plasticity in the mature brain. Moreover, Reelin is expressed in many extraneuronal tissues; yet the roles of peripheral Reelin are largely unknown. In the brain, many of Reelin's functions are mediated by a molecular signaling cascade that involves two lipoprotein receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (Apoer2) and very low density-lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr), the neuronal phosphoprotein Disabled-1 (Dab1), and members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases as crucial elements. This core signaling pathway in turn modulates the activity of adaptor proteins and downstream protein kinase cascades, many of which target the neuronal cytoskeleton. However, additional Reelin-binding receptors have been postulated or described, either as coreceptors that are essential for the activation of the \"canonical\" Reelin signaling cascade involving Apoer2/Vldlr and Dab1, or as receptors that activate alternative or additional signaling pathways. Here we will give an overview of canonical and alternative Reelin signaling pathways, molecular mechanisms involved, and their potential physiological roles in the context of different biological settings.\n",

Surprisingly, it was discovered that two LDLR family members, ApoE receptor 2 (Apoer2) and VLDL receptor (Vldlr), play key roles in brain development and adult synaptic plasticity, primarily by mediating Reelin signaling.

      "High amylase activity in dogs is associated with a drastic increase in copy numbers of the gene coding for pancreatic amylase, AMY2B, that likely allowed dogs to thrive on a relatively starch-rich diet during early dog domestication. Although most dogs thus probably digest starch more efficiently than do wolves, AMY2B copy numbers vary widely within the dog population, and it is not clear how this variation affects the individual ability to handle starch nor how it affects dog health. In humans, copy numbers of the gene coding for salivary amylase, AMY1, correlate with both salivary amylase levels and enzyme activity, and high amylase activity is related to improved glycemic homeostasis and lower frequencies of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigate the relationship between AMY2B copy numbers and serum amylase activity in dogs and show that amylase activity correlates with AMY2B copy numbers. We then describe how AMY2B copy numbers vary in individuals from 20 dog breeds and find strong breed-dependent patterns, indicating that the ability to digest starch varies both at the breed and individual level. Finally, to test whether AMY2B copy number is strongly associated with the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, we compare copy numbers in cases and controls as well as in breeds with varying diabetes susceptibility. Although we see no such association here, future studies using larger cohorts are needed before excluding a possible link between AMY2B and diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Prolonged human interactions and artificial selection have influenced the genotypic and phenotypic diversity among dog breeds. Because humans and dogs occupy diverse habitats, ecological contexts have likely contributed to breed-specific positive selection. Prior to the advent of modern dog-feeding practices, there was likely substantial variation in dietary landscapes among disparate dog breeds. As such, we investigated one type of genetic variant, copy number variation, in three metabolic genes: glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), phytanol-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH), and pancreatic α-amylase 2B (AMY2B). These genes code for proteins that are responsible for metabolizing dietary products that originate from distinctly different food types: sugar, meat, and starch, respectively. After surveying copy number variation among dogs with diverse dietary histories, we found no correlation between diet and positive selection in either GCKR or PHYH. Although it has been previously demonstrated that dogs experienced a copy number increase in AMY2B relative to wolves during or after the dog domestication process, we demonstrate that positive selection continued to act on amylase copy number in dog breeds that consumed starch-rich diets in time periods after domestication. Furthermore, we found that introgression with wolves is not responsible for deterioration of positive selection on AMY2B among diverse dog breeds. Together, this supports the hypothesis that the amylase copy number expansion is found universally in dogs.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent, and physical exercise represents one of the most effective methods to attenuate NAFLD. However, the mechanism of aerobic exercise improving NAFLD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on CNPY2-PERK pathway in mice with NAFLD. Our study found that a high-fat diet induced NAFLD, causing an abnormal lipid metabolism and liver function injury, and increased the expressions of CNPY2, CNPY2 mRNA, PERK, PERK mRNA, p-eIF2a and CHOP. However, aerobic exercise reversesd all these parameters. These data suggest that CNPY2-PERK pathway is involved in the formation of NAFLD, and aerobic exercise can effectively improve NAFLD, which may be related to down-regulate the protein expressions of the CNPY2-PERK pathway.\n",

      "EGFL7 is a secreted angiogenic factor that is highly conserved in vertebrates. Most secreted angiogenic signaling molecules, including VEGF and fibroblast growth factor-2, are mainly expressed by non-endothelial cell types such as fibroblasts. In contrast, EGFL7 is unique because it is almost exclusively expressed by and acts on endothelial cells. Egfl7 expression is highest when the endothelium is in an active, proliferating state. This factor acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and binds to components of the extracellular matrix. In vivo, Egfl7 is important for regulating tubulogenesis in zebrafish and for controlling vascular patterning and integrity in mice. Its function in blood vessel development is mediated, at least in part, through modulation of Notch signaling. In this review, we summarize the findings that support a role for Egfl7 in developmental and postnatal angiogenesis and describe the EGFL7-signaling pathways that underlie these processes. In addition, we discuss a potential role for EGFL7 in vascular repair and its possible use as a therapeutic target for treatment of hypoxia-induced injury. Finally, we consider EGFL7 action during tumorigenesis and its potential as an antiangiogenic agent.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein 7 (EGFL7), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family, is a potent angiogenic factor expressed in many different cell types. EGFL7 plays a vital role in controlling vascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the main signaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulating evidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has been frequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma, colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression of miR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role in oncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in both the osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activities via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of its angiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, such as ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.\n",

      "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis and permeability should enable the development of more effective therapies for various diseases, including retinopathy, cancer, and other vascular disorders. We focused on epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) which plays an important role in NOTCH signaling and in the organization of angiogenic sprouts. We developed an EGFL7-knockdown in vitro microvessel model and investigated the effect of EGFL7 at a tissue level. We found EGFL7 knockdown suppressed VEGF-A-induced sprouting angiogenesis accompanied by an overproduction of endothelial filopodia and reduced collagen IV deposition at the basal side of endothelial cells. We also observed impaired barrier function which reflected an inflammatory condition. Furthermore, our results showed that proper formation of adherens junctions and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was disturbed. In conclusion, by using a 3D microvessel model we identified novel roles for EGFL7 in endothelial function during sprouting angiogenesis.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "It is now about 20 years since the first case of a gain-of-function mutation involving the as-yet-unknown actor in cholesterol homeostasis, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), was described. It was soon clear that this protein would have been of huge scientific and clinical value as a therapeutic strategy for dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) management. Indeed, PCSK9 is a serine protease belonging to the proprotein convertase family, mainly produced by the liver, and essential for metabolism of LDL particles by inhibiting LDL receptor (LDLR) recirculation to the cell surface with the consequent upregulation of LDLR-dependent LDL-C levels. Beyond its effects on LDL metabolism, several studies revealed the existence of additional roles of PCSK9 in different stages of atherosclerosis, also for its ability to target other members of the LDLR family. PCSK9 from plasma and vascular cells can contribute to the development of atherosclerotic plaque and thrombosis by promoting platelet activation, leukocyte recruitment and clot formation, also through mechanisms not related to systemic lipid changes. These results further supported the value for the potential cardiovascular benefits of therapies based on PCSK9 inhibition. Actually, the passive immunization with anti-PCSK9 antibodies, evolocumab and alirocumab, is shown to be effective in dramatically reducing the LDL-C levels and attenuating CVD. While monoclonal antibodies sequester circulating PCSK9, inclisiran, a small interfering RNA, is a new drug that inhibits PCSK9 synthesis with the important advantage, compared with PCSK9 mAbs, to preserve its pharmacodynamic effects when administrated every 6 months. Here, we will focus on the major understandings related to PCSK9, from its discovery to its role in lipoprotein metabolism, involvement in atherothrombosis and a brief excursus on approved current therapies used to inhibit its action.\n",

      "The angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4 and 8 have emerged as key regulators of plasma lipid metabolism by serving as potent inhibitors of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In this review, we provide an integrated picture of the role of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 in lipid metabolism by focusing on their impact on LPL activity and plasma triglyceride clearance during physiological conditions such as fasting, refeeding, exercise and cold exposure.\n",
      "Upon refeeding, circulating ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 promote the replenishment of white adipose tissue depots by specifically inhibiting LPL activity in oxidative tissues. During exercise and cold exposure, ANGPTL4 represses local LPL activity to assure that plasma triglycerides are specifically shuttled to exercising muscle and brown adipose tissue, respectively. Overall, ANGPTL4 is the central component of a fatty acid-driven feedback mechanism that regulates plasma triglyceride hydrolysis and subsequent tissue fatty acid uptake in response to changes in lipid availability and cellular fuel demand.\n",
      "ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 together ensure that triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are adequately distributed during different physiological conditions. The impact of the ANGPTLs on plasma lipid levels has led to scrutiny of ANGPTLs as therapeutic targets for dyslipidemia.\n",

      "Microglia, once viewed as static bystanders with limited homeostatic functions, are now considered key players in the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial activation is a salient feature of neuroinflammation involving a dynamic process that generates multitudinous microglial phenotypes that can respond to a variety of situational cues in the central nervous system. Recently, a flurry of single cell RNA-sequencing studies have defined microglial phenotypes in unprecedented detail, and have highlighted robust changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Increased expression of genes such as Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) in microglia during development, damage, and disease, suggest that increased lipid metabolism is needed to fuel protective cellular functions such as phagocytosis. This review describes our current understanding of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in microglia, and highlights microglial lipid metabolism as a modifiable target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "A major step in energy metabolism is hydrolysis of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) to release fatty acids that can be used or stored. This is accomplished by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at 'binding lipolysis sites' at the vascular endothelium. A multitude of interactions are involved in this seemingly simple reaction. Recent advances in the understanding of some of these factors will be discussed in an attempt to build a comprehensive picture.\n",
      "The first event in catabolism of TRLs is that they dock at the vascular endothelium. This requires LPL and GPIHBP1, the endothelial transporter of LPL.Kinetic studies in rats with labeled chylomicrons showed that once a chylomicron has docked in the heart it stays for minutes and a large number of triacylglycerol molecules are split. The distribution of binding between tissues reflects the amount of LPL, as evident from studies with mutant mice.Clearance of TRLs is often slowed down in metabolic disease, as was demonstrated both in mice and men. In mice, this was directly connected to decreased amounts of endothelial LPL.\n",

      "The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is the founding member of a family of seven structurally closely related transmembrane proteins (LRP1, LRP1b, megalin/LRP2, LDL receptor, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, MEGF7/LRP4, LRP8/apolipoprotein E receptor2). These proteins participate in a wide range of physiological processes, including the regulation of lipid metabolism, protection against atherosclerosis, neurodevelopment, and transport of nutrients and vitamins. While currently available data suggest that the role of the LDL receptor is limited to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles, there is growing experimental evidence that the other members of the gene family have additional physiological functions as signal transducers. In this review, we focus on the latest discovered functions of two major members of this family, LRP1 and megalin/LRP2, and on the newly elucidated physiological role of a third member of the family, MEGF7/LRP4, which can also function as a modulator of diverse signaling pathways during development.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized with progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature that occurs prior to neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction. Mounting evidence suggests that aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau leads to synaptic deficits and neurodegeneration, thereby to memory loss. Among the established genetic risk factors for AD, the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor. We and others previously demonstrated that apoE regulates Aβ aggregation and clearance in an isoform-dependent manner. While the effect of apoE on Aβ may explain how apoE isoforms differentially affect AD pathogenesis, there are also other underexplored pathogenic mechanisms. They include differential effects of apoE on cerebral energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, neurovascular function, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. ApoE is a major carrier of cholesterols that are required for neuronal activity and injury repair in the brain. Although there are a few conflicting findings and the underlying mechanism is still unclear, several lines of studies demonstrated that apoE4 leads to synaptic deficits and impairment in long-term potentiation, memory and cognition. In this review, we summarize current understanding of apoE function in the brain, with a particular emphasis on its role in synaptic plasticity and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, involving low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), syndecan, and LRP8/ApoER2.\n",

      "The LDL receptor gene family constitutes a class of structurally closely related cell surface receptors fulfilling diverse functions in different organs, tissues, and cell types. The LDL receptor is the prototype of this family, which also includes the VLDLR, ApoER2/LRP8, LRP1 and LRP1B, as well as Megalin/GP330, SorLA/LR11, LRP5, LRP6 and MEGF7. Recently several lines of evidence have positioned the LDL receptor gene family as one of the key players in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Initially this receptor family was of high interest due to its key function in cholesterol/apolipoprotein E (ApoE) uptake, with the epsilon4 allele of ApoE as the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. It has been established that the cholesterol metabolism of the cell has a strong impact on the production of Abeta, the major component of the plaques found in the brain of AD-patients. The original report that soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing the kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain might act as a ligand for LRP1 led to a complex investigation of the interaction of both proteins and their potential function in AD development. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that LRP1 might bind to APP independent of the KPI domain in APP. This APP - LRP1 interaction is facilitated through a trimeric complex of APP-FE65-LRP1, which has a functional role in APP processing. Along with LRP1, APP is transported from the early secretory compartments to the cell surface and subsequently internalised into the endosomal / lysosomal compartments. Recent investigations indicate that ApoER2 and SorLA fulfil a similar role in shifting APP localisation in the cell, which affects APP processing and the production of the APP derived amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). In addition to the effect of lipoprotein receptors on APP processing and Abeta production, LRP1 has been shown to bind Abeta directly or indirectly through Abeta-lactoferrin, Abeta-alpha2M and Abeta-ApoE complexes in vitro and in vivo. Based on these observations two LRP1 mediated clearance mechanisms of Abeta are proposed to play a crucial role in the prevention of AD: either Abeta-uptake into a cell with its subsequent degradation or its transport out of the brain over the blood brain barrier into the periphery. Following this export Abeta is degraded in the liver, where LRP1 potentially conducts the removal of Abeta from the blood stream. Although the involvement of LDLR family members in AD is not yet fully understood it becomes clear that they can directly affect APP production, Abeta-clearance and Abeta-transport over the blood brain barrier.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) binds to LDL receptor (LDLR) and targets it for lysosomal degradation in cells. Decreased hepatic clearance of plasma LDL-cholesterol is the primary gauge of PCSK9 activity in humans; however, PCSK9's evolutionary role may extend to other lipoprotein classes and processes. This review highlights studies that are providing novel insights into physiological regulation of PCSK9 transcription and plasma PCSK9 activity.\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that circulating PCSK9 binds to apolipoprotein B100 on LDL particles, which in turn inhibits PCSK9's ability to bind to cell surface LDLRs. Negative feedback of secreted PCSK9 activity by LDL could serve to increase plasma excursion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and monitor lipoprotein remodeling. Recent findings have identified hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α as a key transcriptional regulator that cooperates with sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 to control PCSK9 expression in hepatocytes in response to nutritional and hormonal inputs, as well as acute inflammation.\n",
      "PCSK9 is an established target for cholesterol-lowering therapies. Further study of PCSK9 regulatory mechanisms may identify additional control points for pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. PCSK9 function could reflect ancient roles in the fasting-feeding cycle and in linking lipoprotein metabolism with innate immunity.\n",

      "The SREBP2/LDLR pathway is sensitive to cholesterol content in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while membrane low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is influenced by sterol response element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL). LDL-C, one of the risk factors in cardiovascular disease, is cleared through endocytosis recycling of LDLR. Therefore, we propose that a balance between LDLR endocytosis recycling and PCSK9-mediated and IDOL-mediated lysosomal LDLR degradation is responsible for cholesterol homeostasis in the ER. For statins that decrease serum LDL-C levels via cholesterol synthesis inhibition, the mechanism by which the statins increase the membrane LDLR may be regulated by cholesterol homeostasis in the ER.\n",

      "Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting diet-induced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b(+/+) and Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, PPAR-delta, PPAR-gamma, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Excessive absorption of products of dietary fat digestion leads to type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related disorders. Mice deficient in the group 1B phospholipase A₂ (Pla2g1b), a gut digestive enzyme, are protected against diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes without displaying dietary lipid malabsorption. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Pla2g1b protects against diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Results showed that the Pla2g1b(-/-) mice had decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice subsequent to feeding a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (hypercaloric) diet. These differences were evident before differences in body weight gains were observed. Injection of Poloxamer 407 to inhibit lipolysis revealed decreased VLDL production in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. Supplementation with lysophosphatidylcholine, the product of Pla2g1b hydrolysis, restored VLDL production rates in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice and further elevated VLDL production in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed decreased postprandial lipidemia compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. These results show that, in addition to dietary fatty acids, gut-derived lysophospholipids derived from Pla2g1b hydrolysis of dietary and biliary phospholipids also promote hepatic VLDL production. Thus, the inhibition of lysophospholipid absorption via Pla2g1b inactivation may prove beneficial against diet-induced hyperlipidemia in addition to the protection against obesity and diabetes.\n",

      "Immunity to intestinal helminth infections has been well studied, but the mechanism of helminth killing prior to expulsion remains unclear. Here we identify epithelial-cell-derived phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> group 1B (PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B) as a host-derived endogenous anthelmintic. PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B is elevated in resistant mice and is responsible for killing tissue-embedded larvae. Despite comparable activities of other essential type-2-dependent immune mechanisms, Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to expel the intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Expression of Pla2g1b by epithelial cells was dependent upon intestinal microbiota, adaptive immunity, and common-gamma chain-dependent signaling. Notably, Pla2g1b was downregulated in susceptible mice and inhibited by IL-4R-signaling in vitro, uncoupling parasite killing from expulsion mechanisms. Resistance was restored in Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice by treating infective H. polygyrus L3 larvae with PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B, which reduced larval phospholipid abundance. These findings uncover epithelial-cell-derived Pla2g1b as an essential mediator of helminth killing, highlighting a previously overlooked mechanism of anti-helminth immunity.\n",

      "Reelin is a glycoprotein that serves important roles both during development (regulation of neuronal migration and brain lamination) and in adulthood (maintenance of synaptic function). A number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Alzheimer's disease and lissencephaly share a common feature of abnormal Reelin expression in the brain. Altered Reelin expression has been hypothesized to impair neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity, leading ultimately to the cognitive deficits present in these disorders. The mechanisms for abnormal Reelin expression in some of these disorders are currently unknown although possible explanations include early developmental insults, mutations, hypermethylation of the promoter for the Reelin gene (RELN), miRNA silencing of Reelin mRNA, FMRP underexpression and Reelin processing abnormalities. Increasing Reelin expression through pharmacological therapies may help ameliorate symptoms resulting from Reelin deficits.

      "Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a major cause of developmental disabilities, severe epilepsy, and reproductive disadvantage. Genes that have been associated to MCD are mainly involved in cell proliferation and specification, neuronal migration, and late cortical organization. Lissencephaly-pachygyria-severe band heterotopia are diffuse neuronal migration disorders causing severe global neurological impairment. Abnormalities of the <i>LIS1, DCX, ARX</i>, <i>RELN</i>, <i>VLDLR</i>, <i>ACTB</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>TUBG1</i>, <i>KIF5C</i>, <i>KIF2A</i>, and <i>CDK5</i> genes have been associated with these malformations. More recent studies have also established a relationship between lissencephaly, with or without associated microcephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis as well as cerebellar hypoplasia, and at times, a morphological pattern consistent with polymicrogyria with mutations of several genes <i>(TUBA1A</i>, <i>TUBA8</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, <i>TUBB2B</i>, <i>TUBB3</i>, and <i>DYNC1H1)</i>, regulating the synthesis and function of microtubule and centrosome key components and hence defined as tubulinopathies. MCD only affecting subsets of neurons, such as mild subcortical band heterotopia and periventricular heterotopia, have been associated with abnormalities of the <i>DCX</i>, <i>FLN1A</i>, and <i>ARFGEF2</i> genes and cause neurological and cognitive impairment that vary from severe to mild deficits. Polymicrogyria results from abnormal late cortical organization and is inconstantly associated with abnormal neuronal migration. Localized polymicrogyria has been associated with anatomo-specific deficits, including disorders of language and higher cognition. Polymicrogyria is genetically heterogeneous, and only in a small minority of patients, a definite genetic cause has been identified. Megalencephaly with normal cortex or polymicrogyria by MRI imaging, hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia can all result from mutations in genes of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Postzygotic mutations have been described for most MCD and can be limited to the dysplastic tissue in the less diffuse forms.\n",

      "Proper neuronal migration and laminar formation during corticogenesis is essential for normal brain function. Disruption of these developmental processes is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of some neuropsychiatric conditions. Especially, Reelin, a glycoprotein mainly secreted by the Cajal-Retzius cells and a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons, has been shown to play a critical role, both during embryonic and postnatal periods. Indeed, animal studies have clearly revealed that Reelin is an essential molecule for proper migration of cortical neurons and finally regulates the cell positioning in the cortex during embryonic and early postnatal stages; by contrast, Reelin signaling is closely involved in synaptic function in adulthood. In humans, genetic studies have shown that the <i>reelin</i> gene (<i>RELN</i>) is associated with a number of psychiatric diseases, including Schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BP) and autistic spectrum disorder. Indeed, <i>Reln</i> haploinsufficiency has been shown to cause cognitive impairment in rodents, suggesting the expression level of the Reelin protein is closely related to the higher brain functions. However, the molecular abnormalities in the Reelin pathway involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders are not yet fully understood. In this article, we review the current progress in the understanding of the Reelin functions that could be related to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, we discuss the basis for selecting Reelin and molecules in its downstream signaling pathway as potential therapeutic targets for psychiatric illnesses.\n",

      "We review the genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their role in AD pathogenesis. More recent advances in understanding of the human genome-technologic advances in methods to analyze millions of polymorphisms in thousands of subjects-have revealed new genes associated with AD risk, including ABCA7, BIN1, CASS4, CD33, CD2AP, CELF1, CLU, CR1, DSG2, EPHA1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5-DBR1, INPP5D, MS4A, MEF2C, NME8, PICALM, PTK2B, SLC24H4-RIN3, SORL1, and ZCWPW1. Emerging technologies to analyze the entire genome in large data sets have also revealed coding variants that increase AD risk: PLD3 and TREM2. We review the relationship between these AD risk genes and the cellular and neuropathologic features of AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, classified as either early onset (under 65 years of age), or late onset (over 65 years of age). Three main genes are involved in early onset AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele has been found to be a main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes that might be potential risk factors for AD, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Recent studies have discovered additional novel genes that might be involved in late-onset AD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). Identification of new AD-related genes is important for better understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Since the differential diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders are difficult, especially in the early stages, genetic testing is essential for diagnostic processes. Next-generation sequencing studies have been successfully used for detecting mutations, monitoring the epigenetic changes, and analyzing transcriptomes. These studies may be a promising approach toward understanding the complete genetic mechanisms of diverse genetic disorders such as AD.\n",

      "Whether cholesterol is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still controversial. Several studies that explored the association between lipids and/or lipid-lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ, CLU), ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7(ABCA7), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Functional cell biology studies further support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of Aβ precursor protein processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase resulting in altered Aβ production. However, conflicting evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk, randomized clinical trials observing no beneficial effect of statin therapy, and cell biology studies suggesting that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol level is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits colocalization of β-secretase 1 and Aβ precursor protein in nonraft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an Aβ-degrading enzyme. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the findings of epidemiological, genetic, and cell biology studies aiming to elucidate the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD.\n",

      "Reelin is a large secreted glycoprotein that is essential for correct neuronal positioning during neurodevelopment and is important for synaptic plasticity in the mature brain. Moreover, Reelin is expressed in many extraneuronal tissues; yet the roles of peripheral Reelin are largely unknown. In the brain, many of Reelin's functions are mediated by a molecular signaling cascade that involves two lipoprotein receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (Apoer2) and very low density-lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr), the neuronal phosphoprotein Disabled-1 (Dab1), and members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases as crucial elements. This core signaling pathway in turn modulates the activity of adaptor proteins and downstream protein kinase cascades, many of which target the neuronal cytoskeleton. However, additional Reelin-binding receptors have been postulated or described, either as coreceptors that are essential for the activation of the \"canonical\" Reelin signaling cascade involving Apoer2/Vldlr and Dab1, or as receptors that activate alternative or additional signaling pathways. Here we will give an overview of canonical and alternative Reelin signaling pathways, molecular mechanisms involved, and their potential physiological roles in the context of different biological settings.\n",

Surprisingly, it was discovered that two LDLR family members, ApoE receptor 2 (Apoer2) and VLDL receptor (Vldlr), play key roles in brain development and adult synaptic plasticity, primarily by mediating Reelin signaling. This review focuses on Apoer2 and Vldlr signaling in the CNS and its role in human disease.\n",

      "Embraced with apolipoproteins (Apo) B and Apo E, triglyceride-enriched very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is secreted by the liver into circulation, mainly during post-meal hours. Here, we present a brief review of the physiological role of VLDL and a systemic review of the emerging evidence supporting its pathological roles. VLDL promotes atherosclerosis in metabolic syndrome (MetS). VLDL isolated from subjects with MetS exhibits cytotoxicity to atrial myocytes, induces atrial myopathy, and promotes vulnerability to atrial fibrillation. VLDL levels are affected by a number of endocrinological disorders and can be increased by therapeutic supplementation with cortisol, growth hormone, progesterone, and estrogen. VLDL promotes aldosterone secretion, which contributes to hypertension. VLDL induces neuroinflammation, leading to cognitive dysfunction. VLDL levels are also correlated with chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disorders, and some dermatological diseases. The extra-hepatic secretion of VLDL derived from intestinal dysbiosis is suggested to be harmful. Emerging evidence suggests disturbed VLDL metabolism in sleep disorders and in cancer development and progression. In addition to VLDL, the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) may affect both VLDL metabolism and carcinogenesis. Overall, emerging evidence supports the pathological roles of VLDL in multi-organ diseases. To better understand the fundamental mechanisms of how VLDL promotes disease development, elucidation of the quality control of VLDL and of the regulation and signaling of VLDLR should be indispensable. With this, successful VLDL-targeted therapies can be discovered in the future.\n",

      "High amylase activity in dogs is associated with a drastic increase in copy numbers of the gene coding for pancreatic amylase, AMY2B, that likely allowed dogs to thrive on a relatively starch-rich diet during early dog domestication. Although most dogs thus probably digest starch more efficiently than do wolves, AMY2B copy numbers vary widely within the dog population, and it is not clear how this variation affects the individual ability to handle starch nor how it affects dog health. In humans, copy numbers of the gene coding for salivary amylase, AMY1, correlate with both salivary amylase levels and enzyme activity, and high amylase activity is related to improved glycemic homeostasis and lower frequencies of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigate the relationship between AMY2B copy numbers and serum amylase activity in dogs and show that amylase activity correlates with AMY2B copy numbers. We then describe how AMY2B copy numbers vary in individuals from 20 dog breeds and find strong breed-dependent patterns, indicating that the ability to digest starch varies both at the breed and individual level. Finally, to test whether AMY2B copy number is strongly associated with the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, we compare copy numbers in cases and controls as well as in breeds with varying diabetes susceptibility. Although we see no such association here, future studies using larger cohorts are needed before excluding a possible link between AMY2B and diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Prolonged human interactions and artificial selection have influenced the genotypic and phenotypic diversity among dog breeds. Because humans and dogs occupy diverse habitats, ecological contexts have likely contributed to breed-specific positive selection. Prior to the advent of modern dog-feeding practices, there was likely substantial variation in dietary landscapes among disparate dog breeds. As such, we investigated one type of genetic variant, copy number variation, in three metabolic genes: glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), phytanol-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH), and pancreatic α-amylase 2B (AMY2B). These genes code for proteins that are responsible for metabolizing dietary products that originate from distinctly different food types: sugar, meat, and starch, respectively. After surveying copy number variation among dogs with diverse dietary histories, we found no correlation between diet and positive selection in either GCKR or PHYH. Although it has been previously demonstrated that dogs experienced a copy number increase in AMY2B relative to wolves during or after the dog domestication process, we demonstrate that positive selection continued to act on amylase copy number in dog breeds that consumed starch-rich diets in time periods after domestication. Furthermore, we found that introgression with wolves is not responsible for deterioration of positive selection on AMY2B among diverse dog breeds. Together, this supports the hypothesis that the amylase copy number expansion is found universally in dogs.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent, and physical exercise represents one of the most effective methods to attenuate NAFLD. However, the mechanism of aerobic exercise improving NAFLD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on CNPY2-PERK pathway in mice with NAFLD. Our study found that a high-fat diet induced NAFLD, causing an abnormal lipid metabolism and liver function injury, and increased the expressions of CNPY2, CNPY2 mRNA, PERK, PERK mRNA, p-eIF2a and CHOP. However, aerobic exercise reversesd all these parameters. These data suggest that CNPY2-PERK pathway is involved in the formation of NAFLD, and aerobic exercise can effectively improve NAFLD, which may be related to down-regulate the protein expressions of the CNPY2-PERK pathway.\n",

      "EGFL7 is a secreted angiogenic factor that is highly conserved in vertebrates. Most secreted angiogenic signaling molecules, including VEGF and fibroblast growth factor-2, are mainly expressed by non-endothelial cell types such as fibroblasts. In contrast, EGFL7 is unique because it is almost exclusively expressed by and acts on endothelial cells. Egfl7 expression is highest when the endothelium is in an active, proliferating state. This factor acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and binds to components of the extracellular matrix. In vivo, Egfl7 is important for regulating tubulogenesis in zebrafish and for controlling vascular patterning and integrity in mice. Its function in blood vessel development is mediated, at least in part, through modulation of Notch signaling. In this review, we summarize the findings that support a role for Egfl7 in developmental and postnatal angiogenesis and describe the EGFL7-signaling pathways that underlie these processes. In addition, we discuss a potential role for EGFL7 in vascular repair and its possible use as a therapeutic target for treatment of hypoxia-induced injury. Finally, we consider EGFL7 action during tumorigenesis and its potential as an antiangiogenic agent.\n",

      "Epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein 7 (EGFL7), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family, is a potent angiogenic factor expressed in many different cell types. EGFL7 plays a vital role in controlling vascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the main signaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulating evidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has been frequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma, colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression of miR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role in oncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in both the osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activities via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of its angiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, such as ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.\n",

      "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis and permeability should enable the development of more effective therapies for various diseases, including retinopathy, cancer, and other vascular disorders. We focused on epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) which plays an important role in NOTCH signaling and in the organization of angiogenic sprouts. We developed an EGFL7-knockdown in vitro microvessel model and investigated the effect of EGFL7 at a tissue level. We found EGFL7 knockdown suppressed VEGF-A-induced sprouting angiogenesis accompanied by an overproduction of endothelial filopodia and reduced collagen IV deposition at the basal side of endothelial cells. We also observed impaired barrier function which reflected an inflammatory condition. Furthermore, our results showed that proper formation of adherens junctions and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was disturbed. In conclusion, by using a 3D microvessel model we identified novel roles for EGFL7 in endothelial function during sprouting angiogenesis.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "The angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4 and 8 have emerged as key regulators of plasma lipid metabolism by serving as potent inhibitors of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In this review, we provide an integrated picture of the role of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 in lipid metabolism by focusing on their impact on LPL activity and plasma triglyceride clearance during physiological conditions such as fasting, refeeding, exercise and cold exposure.\n",
      "Upon refeeding, circulating ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 promote the replenishment of white adipose tissue depots by specifically inhibiting LPL activity in oxidative tissues. During exercise and cold exposure, ANGPTL4 represses local LPL activity to assure that plasma triglycerides are specifically shuttled to exercising muscle and brown adipose tissue, respectively. Overall, ANGPTL4 is the central component of a fatty acid-driven feedback mechanism that regulates plasma triglyceride hydrolysis and subsequent tissue fatty acid uptake in response to changes in lipid availability and cellular fuel demand.\n",
      "ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 together ensure that triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are adequately distributed during different physiological conditions.

      "Microglia, once viewed as static bystanders with limited homeostatic functions, are now considered key players in the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial activation is a salient feature of neuroinflammation involving a dynamic process that generates multitudinous microglial phenotypes that can respond to a variety of situational cues in the central nervous system. Recently, a flurry of single cell RNA-sequencing studies have defined microglial phenotypes in unprecedented detail, and have highlighted robust changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Increased expression of genes such as Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) in microglia during development, damage, and disease, suggest that increased lipid metabolism is needed to fuel protective cellular functions such as phagocytosis. This review describes our current understanding of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in microglia, and highlights microglial lipid metabolism as a modifiable target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "A major step in energy metabolism is hydrolysis of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) to release fatty acids that can be used or stored. This is accomplished by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at 'binding lipolysis sites' at the vascular endothelium. A multitude of interactions are involved in this seemingly simple reaction. Recent advances in the understanding of some of these factors will be discussed in an attempt to build a comprehensive picture.\n",
      "The first event in catabolism of TRLs is that they dock at the vascular endothelium. This requires LPL and GPIHBP1, the endothelial transporter of LPL.Kinetic studies in rats with labeled chylomicrons showed that once a chylomicron has docked in the heart it stays for minutes and a large number of triacylglycerol molecules are split. The distribution of binding between tissues reflects the amount of LPL, as evident from studies with mutant mice.Clearance of TRLs is often slowed down in metabolic disease, as was demonstrated both in mice and men. In mice, this was directly connected to decreased amounts of endothelial LPL.\n",

      "The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is the founding member of a family of seven structurally closely related transmembrane proteins (LRP1, LRP1b, megalin/LRP2, LDL receptor, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, MEGF7/LRP4, LRP8/apolipoprotein E receptor2). These proteins participate in a wide range of physiological processes, including the regulation of lipid metabolism, protection against atherosclerosis, neurodevelopment, and transport of nutrients and vitamins. While currently available data suggest that the role of the LDL receptor is limited to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles, there is growing experimental evidence that the other members of the gene family have additional physiological functions as signal transducers. In this review, we focus on the latest discovered functions of two major members of this family, LRP1 and megalin/LRP2, and on the newly elucidated physiological role of a third member of the family, MEGF7/LRP4, which can also function as a modulator of diverse signaling pathways during development.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized with progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature that occurs prior to neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction. Mounting evidence suggests that aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau leads to synaptic deficits and neurodegeneration, thereby to memory loss. Among the established genetic risk factors for AD, the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor. We and others previously demonstrated that apoE regulates Aβ aggregation and clearance in an isoform-dependent manner. While the effect of apoE on Aβ may explain how apoE isoforms differentially affect AD pathogenesis, there are also other underexplored pathogenic mechanisms. They include differential effects of apoE on cerebral energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, neurovascular function, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. ApoE is a major carrier of cholesterols that are required for neuronal activity and injury repair in the brain. Although there are a few conflicting findings and the underlying mechanism is still unclear, several lines of studies demonstrated that apoE4 leads to synaptic deficits and impairment in long-term potentiation, memory and cognition. In this review, we summarize current understanding of apoE function in the brain, with a particular emphasis on its role in synaptic plasticity and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, involving low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), syndecan, and LRP8/ApoER2.\n",

      "The LDL receptor gene family constitutes a class of structurally closely related cell surface receptors fulfilling diverse functions in different organs, tissues, and cell types. The LDL receptor is the prototype of this family, which also includes the VLDLR, ApoER2/LRP8, LRP1 and LRP1B, as well as Megalin/GP330, SorLA/LR11, LRP5, LRP6 and MEGF7. Recently several lines of evidence have positioned the LDL receptor gene family as one of the key players in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Initially this receptor family was of high interest due to its key function in cholesterol/apolipoprotein E (ApoE) uptake, with the epsilon4 allele of ApoE as the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. It has been established that the cholesterol metabolism of the cell has a strong impact on the production of Abeta, the major component of the plaques found in the brain of AD-patients. The original report that soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing the kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain might act as a ligand for LRP1 led to a complex investigation of the interaction of both proteins and their potential function in AD development. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that LRP1 might bind to APP independent of the KPI domain in APP. This APP - LRP1 interaction is facilitated through a trimeric complex of APP-FE65-LRP1, which has a functional role in APP processing. Along with LRP1, APP is transported from the early secretory compartments to the cell surface and subsequently internalised into the endosomal / lysosomal compartments. Recent investigations indicate that ApoER2 and SorLA fulfil a similar role in shifting APP localisation in the cell, which affects APP processing and the production of the APP derived amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). In addition to the effect of lipoprotein receptors on APP processing and Abeta production, LRP1 has been shown to bind Abeta directly or indirectly through Abeta-lactoferrin, Abeta-alpha2M and Abeta-ApoE complexes in vitro and in vivo. Based on these observations two LRP1 mediated clearance mechanisms of Abeta are proposed to play a crucial role in the prevention of AD: either Abeta-uptake into a cell with its subsequent degradation or its transport out of the brain over the blood brain barrier into the periphery. Following this export Abeta is degraded in the liver, where LRP1 potentially conducts the removal of Abeta from the blood stream. Although the involvement of LDLR family members in AD is not yet fully understood it becomes clear that they can directly affect APP production, Abeta-clearance and Abeta-transport over the blood brain barrier.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) binds to LDL receptor (LDLR) and targets it for lysosomal degradation in cells. Decreased hepatic clearance of plasma LDL-cholesterol is the primary gauge of PCSK9 activity in humans; however, PCSK9's evolutionary role may extend to other lipoprotein classes and processes. This review highlights studies that are providing novel insights into physiological regulation of PCSK9 transcription and plasma PCSK9 activity.\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that circulating PCSK9 binds to apolipoprotein B100 on LDL particles, which in turn inhibits PCSK9's ability to bind to cell surface LDLRs. Negative feedback of secreted PCSK9 activity by LDL could serve to increase plasma excursion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and monitor lipoprotein remodeling. Recent findings have identified hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α as a key transcriptional regulator that cooperates with sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 to control PCSK9 expression in hepatocytes in response to nutritional and hormonal inputs, as well as acute inflammation.\n",
      "PCSK9 is an established target for cholesterol-lowering therapies. Further study of PCSK9 regulatory mechanisms may identify additional control points for pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. PCSK9 function could reflect ancient roles in the fasting-feeding cycle and in linking lipoprotein metabolism with innate immunity.\n",

LDL-C, one of the risk factors in cardiovascular disease, is cleared through endocytosis recycling of LDLR. Therefore, we propose that a balance between LDLR endocytosis recycling and PCSK9-mediated and IDOL-mediated lysosomal LDLR degradation is responsible for cholesterol homeostasis in the ER.

      "Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting diet-induced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b(+/+) and Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, PPAR-delta, PPAR-gamma, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Excessive absorption of products of dietary fat digestion leads to type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related disorders. Mice deficient in the group 1B phospholipase A₂ (Pla2g1b), a gut digestive enzyme, are protected against diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes without displaying dietary lipid malabsorption. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Pla2g1b protects against diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Results showed that the Pla2g1b(-/-) mice had decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice subsequent to feeding a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (hypercaloric) diet. These differences were evident before differences in body weight gains were observed. Injection of Poloxamer 407 to inhibit lipolysis revealed decreased VLDL production in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. Supplementation with lysophosphatidylcholine, the product of Pla2g1b hydrolysis, restored VLDL production rates in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice and further elevated VLDL production in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed decreased postprandial lipidemia compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. These results show that, in addition to dietary fatty acids, gut-derived lysophospholipids derived from Pla2g1b hydrolysis of dietary and biliary phospholipids also promote hepatic VLDL production. Thus, the inhibition of lysophospholipid absorption via Pla2g1b inactivation may prove beneficial against diet-induced hyperlipidemia in addition to the protection against obesity and diabetes.\n",

      "Immunity to intestinal helminth infections has been well studied, but the mechanism of helminth killing prior to expulsion remains unclear. Here we identify epithelial-cell-derived phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> group 1B (PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B) as a host-derived endogenous anthelmintic. PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B is elevated in resistant mice and is responsible for killing tissue-embedded larvae. Despite comparable activities of other essential type-2-dependent immune mechanisms, Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to expel the intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Expression of Pla2g1b by epithelial cells was dependent upon intestinal microbiota, adaptive immunity, and common-gamma chain-dependent signaling. Notably, Pla2g1b was downregulated in susceptible mice and inhibited by IL-4R-signaling in vitro, uncoupling parasite killing from expulsion mechanisms. Resistance was restored in Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice by treating infective H. polygyrus L3 larvae with PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B, which reduced larval phospholipid abundance. These findings uncover epithelial-cell-derived Pla2g1b as an essential mediator of helminth killing, highlighting a previously overlooked mechanism of anti-helminth immunity.\n",

      "Reelin is a glycoprotein that serves important roles both during development (regulation of neuronal migration and brain lamination) and in adulthood (maintenance of synaptic function). A number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Alzheimer's disease and lissencephaly share a common feature of abnormal Reelin expression in the brain. Altered Reelin expression has been hypothesized to impair neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity, leading ultimately to the cognitive deficits present in these disorders. The mechanisms for abnormal Reelin expression in some of these disorders are currently unknown although possible explanations include early developmental insults, mutations, hypermethylation of the promoter for the Reelin gene (RELN), miRNA silencing of Reelin mRNA, FMRP underexpression and Reelin processing abnormalities. Increasing Reelin expression through pharmacological therapies may help ameliorate symptoms resulting from Reelin deficits.

      "Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a major cause of developmental disabilities, severe epilepsy, and reproductive disadvantage. Genes that have been associated to MCD are mainly involved in cell proliferation and specification, neuronal migration, and late cortical organization. Lissencephaly-pachygyria-severe band heterotopia are diffuse neuronal migration disorders causing severe global neurological impairment. Abnormalities of the <i>LIS1, DCX, ARX</i>, <i>RELN</i>, <i>VLDLR</i>, <i>ACTB</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>TUBG1</i>, <i>KIF5C</i>, <i>KIF2A</i>, and <i>CDK5</i> genes have been associated with these malformations. More recent studies have also established a relationship between lissencephaly, with or without associated microcephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis as well as cerebellar hypoplasia, and at times, a morphological pattern consistent with polymicrogyria with mutations of several genes <i>(TUBA1A</i>, <i>TUBA8</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, <i>TUBB2B</i>, <i>TUBB3</i>, and <i>DYNC1H1)</i>, regulating the synthesis and function of microtubule and centrosome key components and hence defined as tubulinopathies. MCD only affecting subsets of neurons, such as mild subcortical band heterotopia and periventricular heterotopia, have been associated with abnormalities of the <i>DCX</i>, <i>FLN1A</i>, and <i>ARFGEF2</i> genes and cause neurological and cognitive impairment that vary from severe to mild deficits. Polymicrogyria results from abnormal late cortical organization and is inconstantly associated with abnormal neuronal migration. Localized polymicrogyria has been associated with anatomo-specific deficits, including disorders of language and higher cognition. Polymicrogyria is genetically heterogeneous, and only in a small minority of patients, a definite genetic cause has been identified. Megalencephaly with normal cortex or polymicrogyria by MRI imaging, hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia can all result from mutations in genes of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Postzygotic mutations have been described for most MCD and can be limited to the dysplastic tissue in the less diffuse forms.\n",

      "Proper neuronal migration and laminar formation during corticogenesis is essential for normal brain function. Disruption of these developmental processes is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of some neuropsychiatric conditions. Especially, Reelin, a glycoprotein mainly secreted by the Cajal-Retzius cells and a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons, has been shown to play a critical role, both during embryonic and postnatal periods. Indeed, animal studies have clearly revealed that Reelin is an essential molecule for proper migration of cortical neurons and finally regulates the cell positioning in the cortex during embryonic and early postnatal stages; by contrast, Reelin signaling is closely involved in synaptic function in adulthood. In humans, genetic studies have shown that the <i>reelin</i> gene (<i>RELN</i>) is associated with a number of psychiatric diseases, including Schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BP) and autistic spectrum disorder. Indeed, <i>Reln</i> haploinsufficiency has been shown to cause cognitive impairment in rodents, suggesting the expression level of the Reelin protein is closely related to the higher brain functions. However, the molecular abnormalities in the Reelin pathway involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders are not yet fully understood. In this article, we review the current progress in the understanding of the Reelin functions that could be related to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, we discuss the basis for selecting Reelin and molecules in its downstream signaling pathway as potential therapeutic targets for psychiatric illnesses.\n",

More recent advances in understanding of the human genome-technologic advances in methods to analyze millions of polymorphisms in thousands of subjects-have revealed new genes associated with AD risk, including ABCA7, BIN1, CASS4, CD33, CD2AP, CELF1, CLU, CR1, DSG2, EPHA1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5-DBR1, INPP5D, MS4A, MEF2C, NME8, PICALM, PTK2B, SLC24H4-RIN3, SORL1, and ZCWPW1. Emerging technologies to analyze the entire genome in large data sets have also revealed coding variants that increase AD risk: PLD3 and TREM2. We review the relationship between these AD risk genes and the cellular and neuropathologic features of AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, classified as either early onset (under 65 years of age), or late onset (over 65 years of age). Three main genes are involved in early onset AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele has been found to be a main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes that might be potential risk factors for AD, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Recent studies have discovered additional novel genes that might be involved in late-onset AD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). Identification of new AD-related genes is important for better understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Since the differential diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders are difficult, especially in the early stages, genetic testing is essential for diagnostic processes. Next-generation sequencing studies have been successfully used for detecting mutations, monitoring the epigenetic changes, and analyzing transcriptomes. These studies may be a promising approach toward understanding the complete genetic mechanisms of diverse genetic disorders such as AD.\n",

      "Whether cholesterol is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still controversial. Several studies that explored the association between lipids and/or lipid-lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ, CLU), ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7(ABCA7), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Functional cell biology studies further support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of Aβ precursor protein processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase resulting in altered Aβ production. However, conflicting evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk, randomized clinical trials observing no beneficial effect of statin therapy, and cell biology studies suggesting that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol level is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits colocalization of β-secretase 1 and Aβ precursor protein in nonraft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an Aβ-degrading enzyme. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the findings of epidemiological, genetic, and cell biology studies aiming to elucidate the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD.\n",

      "The liver and the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) play major roles in TG and VLDL metabolism. However, the exact role of liver VLDLR is not well known because of the absence of or difficulty in detecting VLDLR in the liver. In this study, we demonstrate that fenofibrate, a PPARα agonist and widely used TG-lowering drug, markedly upregulated hepatic VLDLR, which is essential for lowering TG. This study also shows that the distinct regulatory roles of PPARα agonists on VLDLR in the liver and peripheral tissues including adipose tissues, heart, and skeletal muscles are due to the pattern of expression of PPARα. The in vivo portion of our study demonstrated that oral fenofibrate robustly increased liver VLDLR expression levels in hyperlipidemic and diabetic mice and significantly reduced the increase in serum TG observed in wt mice after feeding with high-fat diet (HFD) but not in Vldlr(-/-) mice or Pparα(-/-) mice. However, overexpression of mouse VLDLR in livers of Vldlr(-/-) mice significantly prevented the increase in serum TG induced by HFD. The in vitro portion of our study showed that fenofibrate upregulated VLDLR transcriptional activity through PPAR response element binding to the VLDLR promoter. The conclusions of our study provide a novel mechanism for the TG-lowering effects of fenofibrate in the treatment of dyslipidemia.\n",

      "The VLDL receptor (VLDLR) is a member of the LDL receptor family. The VLDLR was hypothesized to mediate fatty acid entry into peripheral tissues, on the basis of its expression in tissues that are active in fatty acid metabolism and its capacity to bind apolipoprotein-E-rich VLDL in vitro. This hypothesis initially proved difficult to confirm, because VLDLR-knockout mice were reported to display normal plasma lipid levels. Moreover, studies in VLDLR-knockout mice that were also deficient in a second LDL receptor family member, the apolipoprotein E receptor 2, indicated a role for the VLDLR in neuronal migration during brain development. However, in accordance with what the term VLDLR suggests, recent studies using VLDLR-deficient and transgenic mice have provided compelling evidence that the VLDLR does indeed play a role in VLDL-triglyceride metabolism, and that it is important for triglyceride storage in the adipocyte.\n",

      "Embraced with apolipoproteins (Apo) B and Apo E, triglyceride-enriched very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is secreted by the liver into circulation, mainly during post-meal hours. Here, we present a brief review of the physiological role of VLDL and a systemic review of the emerging evidence supporting its pathological roles. VLDL promotes atherosclerosis in metabolic syndrome (MetS). VLDL isolated from subjects with MetS exhibits cytotoxicity to atrial myocytes, induces atrial myopathy, and promotes vulnerability to atrial fibrillation. VLDL levels are affected by a number of endocrinological disorders and can be increased by therapeutic supplementation with cortisol, growth hormone, progesterone, and estrogen. VLDL promotes aldosterone secretion, which contributes to hypertension. VLDL induces neuroinflammation, leading to cognitive dysfunction. VLDL levels are also correlated with chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disorders, and some dermatological diseases. The extra-hepatic secretion of VLDL derived from intestinal dysbiosis is suggested to be harmful. Emerging evidence suggests disturbed VLDL metabolism in sleep disorders and in cancer development and progression. In addition to VLDL, the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) may affect both VLDL metabolism and carcinogenesis. Overall, emerging evidence supports the pathological roles of VLDL in multi-organ diseases. To better understand the fundamental mechanisms of how VLDL promotes disease development, elucidation of the quality control of VLDL and of the regulation and signaling of VLDLR should be indispensable. With this, successful VLDL-targeted therapies can be discovered in the future.\n",

      "High amylase activity in dogs is associated with a drastic increase in copy numbers of the gene coding for pancreatic amylase, AMY2B, that likely allowed dogs to thrive on a relatively starch-rich diet during early dog domestication. Although most dogs thus probably digest starch more efficiently than do wolves, AMY2B copy numbers vary widely within the dog population, and it is not clear how this variation affects the individual ability to handle starch nor how it affects dog health. In humans, copy numbers of the gene coding for salivary amylase, AMY1, correlate with both salivary amylase levels and enzyme activity, and high amylase activity is related to improved glycemic homeostasis and lower frequencies of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigate the relationship between AMY2B copy numbers and serum amylase activity in dogs and show that amylase activity correlates with AMY2B copy numbers. We then describe how AMY2B copy numbers vary in individuals from 20 dog breeds and find strong breed-dependent patterns, indicating that the ability to digest starch varies both at the breed and individual level. Finally, to test whether AMY2B copy number is strongly associated with the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, we compare copy numbers in cases and controls as well as in breeds with varying diabetes susceptibility. Although we see no such association here, future studies using larger cohorts are needed before excluding a possible link between AMY2B and diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Prolonged human interactions and artificial selection have influenced the genotypic and phenotypic diversity among dog breeds. Because humans and dogs occupy diverse habitats, ecological contexts have likely contributed to breed-specific positive selection. Prior to the advent of modern dog-feeding practices, there was likely substantial variation in dietary landscapes among disparate dog breeds. As such, we investigated one type of genetic variant, copy number variation, in three metabolic genes: glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), phytanol-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH), and pancreatic α-amylase 2B (AMY2B). These genes code for proteins that are responsible for metabolizing dietary products that originate from distinctly different food types: sugar, meat, and starch, respectively. After surveying copy number variation among dogs with diverse dietary histories, we found no correlation between diet and positive selection in either GCKR or PHYH. Although it has been previously demonstrated that dogs experienced a copy number increase in AMY2B relative to wolves during or after the dog domestication process, we demonstrate that positive selection continued to act on amylase copy number in dog breeds that consumed starch-rich diets in time periods after domestication. Furthermore, we found that introgression with wolves is not responsible for deterioration of positive selection on AMY2B among diverse dog breeds. Together, this supports the hypothesis that the amylase copy number expansion is found universally in dogs.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent, and physical exercise represents one of the most effective methods to attenuate NAFLD. However, the mechanism of aerobic exercise improving NAFLD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on CNPY2-PERK pathway in mice with NAFLD. Our study found that a high-fat diet induced NAFLD, causing an abnormal lipid metabolism and liver function injury, and increased the expressions of CNPY2, CNPY2 mRNA, PERK, PERK mRNA, p-eIF2a and CHOP. However, aerobic exercise reversesd all these parameters. These data suggest that CNPY2-PERK pathway is involved in the formation of NAFLD, and aerobic exercise can effectively improve NAFLD, which may be related to down-regulate the protein expressions of the CNPY2-PERK pathway.\n",

      "EGFL7 is a secreted angiogenic factor that is highly conserved in vertebrates. Most secreted angiogenic signaling molecules, including VEGF and fibroblast growth factor-2, are mainly expressed by non-endothelial cell types such as fibroblasts. In contrast, EGFL7 is unique because it is almost exclusively expressed by and acts on endothelial cells. Egfl7 expression is highest when the endothelium is in an active, proliferating state. This factor acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and binds to components of the extracellular matrix. In vivo, Egfl7 is important for regulating tubulogenesis in zebrafish and for controlling vascular patterning and integrity in mice. Its function in blood vessel development is mediated, at least in part, through modulation of Notch signaling. In this review, we summarize the findings that support a role for Egfl7 in developmental and postnatal angiogenesis and describe the EGFL7-signaling pathways that underlie these processes. In addition, we discuss a potential role for EGFL7 in vascular repair and its possible use as a therapeutic target for treatment of hypoxia-induced injury. Finally, we consider EGFL7 action during tumorigenesis and its potential as an antiangiogenic agent.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein 7 (EGFL7), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family, is a potent angiogenic factor expressed in many different cell types. EGFL7 plays a vital role in controlling vascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the main signaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulating evidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has been frequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma, colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression of miR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role in oncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in both the osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activities via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of its angiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, such as ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.\n",

      "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis and permeability should enable the development of more effective therapies for various diseases, including retinopathy, cancer, and other vascular disorders. We focused on epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) which plays an important role in NOTCH signaling and in the organization of angiogenic sprouts. We developed an EGFL7-knockdown in vitro microvessel model and investigated the effect of EGFL7 at a tissue level. We found EGFL7 knockdown suppressed VEGF-A-induced sprouting angiogenesis accompanied by an overproduction of endothelial filopodia and reduced collagen IV deposition at the basal side of endothelial cells. We also observed impaired barrier function which reflected an inflammatory condition. Furthermore, our results showed that proper formation of adherens junctions and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was disturbed. In conclusion, by using a 3D microvessel model we identified novel roles for EGFL7 in endothelial function during sprouting angiogenesis.\n",

      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "The angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4 and 8 have emerged as key regulators of plasma lipid metabolism by serving as potent inhibitors of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In this review, we provide an integrated picture of the role of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 in lipid metabolism by focusing on their impact on LPL activity and plasma triglyceride clearance during physiological conditions such as fasting, refeeding, exercise and cold exposure.\n",
      "Upon refeeding, circulating ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 promote the replenishment of white adipose tissue depots by specifically inhibiting LPL activity in oxidative tissues. During exercise and cold exposure, ANGPTL4 represses local LPL activity to assure that plasma triglycerides are specifically shuttled to exercising muscle and brown adipose tissue, respectively. Overall, ANGPTL4 is the central component of a fatty acid-driven feedback mechanism that regulates plasma triglyceride hydrolysis and subsequent tissue fatty acid uptake in response to changes in lipid availability and cellular fuel demand.\n",
      "ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 together ensure that triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are adequately distributed during different physiological conditions. The impact of the ANGPTLs on plasma lipid levels has led to scrutiny of ANGPTLs as therapeutic targets for dyslipidemia.\n",

      "Microglia, once viewed as static bystanders with limited homeostatic functions, are now considered key players in the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial activation is a salient feature of neuroinflammation involving a dynamic process that generates multitudinous microglial phenotypes that can respond to a variety of situational cues in the central nervous system. Recently, a flurry of single cell RNA-sequencing studies have defined microglial phenotypes in unprecedented detail, and have highlighted robust changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Increased expression of genes such as Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) in microglia during development, damage, and disease, suggest that increased lipid metabolism is needed to fuel protective cellular functions such as phagocytosis. This review describes our current understanding of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in microglia, and highlights microglial lipid metabolism as a modifiable target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "A major step in energy metabolism is hydrolysis of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) to release fatty acids that can be used or stored. This is accomplished by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at 'binding lipolysis sites' at the vascular endothelium. A multitude of interactions are involved in this seemingly simple reaction. Recent advances in the understanding of some of these factors will be discussed in an attempt to build a comprehensive picture.\n",
      "The first event in catabolism of TRLs is that they dock at the vascular endothelium. This requires LPL and GPIHBP1, the endothelial transporter of LPL.Kinetic studies in rats with labeled chylomicrons showed that once a chylomicron has docked in the heart it stays for minutes and a large number of triacylglycerol molecules are split. The distribution of binding between tissues reflects the amount of LPL, as evident from studies with mutant mice.Clearance of TRLs is often slowed down in metabolic disease, as was demonstrated both in mice and men. In mice, this was directly connected to decreased amounts of endothelial LPL.\n",
      "The LPL system is central in energy metabolism and results from interplay between several factors. Rapid and exciting progress is being made.\n",

      "The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is the founding member of a family of seven structurally closely related transmembrane proteins (LRP1, LRP1b, megalin/LRP2, LDL receptor, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, MEGF7/LRP4, LRP8/apolipoprotein E receptor2). These proteins participate in a wide range of physiological processes, including the regulation of lipid metabolism, protection against atherosclerosis, neurodevelopment, and transport of nutrients and vitamins. While currently available data suggest that the role of the LDL receptor is limited to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles, there is growing experimental evidence that the other members of the gene family have additional physiological functions as signal transducers. In this review, we focus on the latest discovered functions of two major members of this family, LRP1 and megalin/LRP2, and on the newly elucidated physiological role of a third member of the family, MEGF7/LRP4, which can also function as a modulator of diverse signaling pathways during development.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized with progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature that occurs prior to neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction. Mounting evidence suggests that aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau leads to synaptic deficits and neurodegeneration, thereby to memory loss. Among the established genetic risk factors for AD, the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor. We and others previously demonstrated that apoE regulates Aβ aggregation and clearance in an isoform-dependent manner. While the effect of apoE on Aβ may explain how apoE isoforms differentially affect AD pathogenesis, there are also other underexplored pathogenic mechanisms. They include differential effects of apoE on cerebral energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, neurovascular function, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. ApoE is a major carrier of cholesterols that are required for neuronal activity and injury repair in the brain. Although there are a few conflicting findings and the underlying mechanism is still unclear, several lines of studies demonstrated that apoE4 leads to synaptic deficits and impairment in long-term potentiation, memory and cognition. In this review, we summarize current understanding of apoE function in the brain, with a particular emphasis on its role in synaptic plasticity and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, involving low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), syndecan, and LRP8/ApoER2.\n",

      "The LDL receptor gene family constitutes a class of structurally closely related cell surface receptors fulfilling diverse functions in different organs, tissues, and cell types. The LDL receptor is the prototype of this family, which also includes the VLDLR, ApoER2/LRP8, LRP1 and LRP1B, as well as Megalin/GP330, SorLA/LR11, LRP5, LRP6 and MEGF7. Recently several lines of evidence have positioned the LDL receptor gene family as one of the key players in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Initially this receptor family was of high interest due to its key function in cholesterol/apolipoprotein E (ApoE) uptake, with the epsilon4 allele of ApoE as the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. It has been established that the cholesterol metabolism of the cell has a strong impact on the production of Abeta, the major component of the plaques found in the brain of AD-patients. The original report that soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing the kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain might act as a ligand for LRP1 led to a complex investigation of the interaction of both proteins and their potential function in AD development. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that LRP1 might bind to APP independent of the KPI domain in APP. This APP - LRP1 interaction is facilitated through a trimeric complex of APP-FE65-LRP1, which has a functional role in APP processing. Along with LRP1, APP is transported from the early secretory compartments to the cell surface and subsequently internalised into the endosomal / lysosomal compartments. Recent investigations indicate that ApoER2 and SorLA fulfil a similar role in shifting APP localisation in the cell, which affects APP processing and the production of the APP derived amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). In addition to the effect of lipoprotein receptors on APP processing and Abeta production, LRP1 has been shown to bind Abeta directly or indirectly through Abeta-lactoferrin, Abeta-alpha2M and Abeta-ApoE complexes in vitro and in vivo. Based on these observations two LRP1 mediated clearance mechanisms of Abeta are proposed to play a crucial role in the prevention of AD: either Abeta-uptake into a cell with its subsequent degradation or its transport out of the brain over the blood brain barrier into the periphery. Following this export Abeta is degraded in the liver, where LRP1 potentially conducts the removal of Abeta from the blood stream. Although the involvement of LDLR family members in AD is not yet fully understood it becomes clear that they can directly affect APP production, Abeta-clearance and Abeta-transport over the blood brain barrier.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

Decreased hepatic clearance of plasma LDL-cholesterol is the primary gauge of PCSK9 activity in humans; however, PCSK9's evolutionary role may extend to other lipoprotein classes and processes. This review highlights studies that are providing novel insights into physiological regulation of PCSK9 transcription and plasma PCSK9 activity.\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that circulating PCSK9 binds to apolipoprotein B100 on LDL particles, which in turn inhibits PCSK9's ability to bind to cell surface LDLRs. Negative feedback of secreted PCSK9 activity by LDL could serve to increase plasma excursion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and monitor lipoprotein remodeling. Recent findings have identified hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α as a key transcriptional regulator that cooperates with sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 to control PCSK9 expression in hepatocytes in response to nutritional and hormonal inputs, as well as acute inflammation.\n",
      "PCSK9 is an established target for cholesterol-lowering therapies. Further study of PCSK9 regulatory mechanisms may identify additional control points for pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. PCSK9 function could reflect ancient roles in the fasting-feeding cycle and in linking lipoprotein metabolism with innate immunity.\n",

      "The SREBP2/LDLR pathway is sensitive to cholesterol content in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while membrane low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is influenced by sterol response element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL). LDL-C, one of the risk factors in cardiovascular disease, is cleared through endocytosis recycling of LDLR. Therefore, we propose that a balance between LDLR endocytosis recycling and PCSK9-mediated and IDOL-mediated lysosomal LDLR degradation is responsible for cholesterol homeostasis in the ER. For statins that decrease serum LDL-C levels via cholesterol synthesis inhibition, the mechanism by which the statins increase the membrane LDLR may be regulated by cholesterol homeostasis in the ER.\n",

      "Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting diet-induced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b(+/+) and Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, PPAR-delta, PPAR-gamma, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Excessive absorption of products of dietary fat digestion leads to type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related disorders. Mice deficient in the group 1B phospholipase A₂ (Pla2g1b), a gut digestive enzyme, are protected against diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes without displaying dietary lipid malabsorption. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Pla2g1b protects against diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Results showed that the Pla2g1b(-/-) mice had decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice subsequent to feeding a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (hypercaloric) diet. These differences were evident before differences in body weight gains were observed. Injection of Poloxamer 407 to inhibit lipolysis revealed decreased VLDL production in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. Supplementation with lysophosphatidylcholine, the product of Pla2g1b hydrolysis, restored VLDL production rates in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice and further elevated VLDL production in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed decreased postprandial lipidemia compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. These results show that, in addition to dietary fatty acids, gut-derived lysophospholipids derived from Pla2g1b hydrolysis of dietary and biliary phospholipids also promote hepatic VLDL production. Thus, the inhibition of lysophospholipid absorption via Pla2g1b inactivation may prove beneficial against diet-induced hyperlipidemia in addition to the protection against obesity and diabetes.\n",

      "Immunity to intestinal helminth infections has been well studied, but the mechanism of helminth killing prior to expulsion remains unclear. Here we identify epithelial-cell-derived phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> group 1B (PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B) as a host-derived endogenous anthelmintic. PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B is elevated in resistant mice and is responsible for killing tissue-embedded larvae. Despite comparable activities of other essential type-2-dependent immune mechanisms, Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to expel the intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Expression of Pla2g1b by epithelial cells was dependent upon intestinal microbiota, adaptive immunity, and common-gamma chain-dependent signaling. Notably, Pla2g1b was downregulated in susceptible mice and inhibited by IL-4R-signaling in vitro, uncoupling parasite killing from expulsion mechanisms. Resistance was restored in Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice by treating infective H. polygyrus L3 larvae with PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B, which reduced larval phospholipid abundance. These findings uncover epithelial-cell-derived Pla2g1b as an essential mediator of helminth killing, highlighting a previously overlooked mechanism of anti-helminth immunity.\n",

      "Reelin is a glycoprotein that serves important roles both during development (regulation of neuronal migration and brain lamination) and in adulthood (maintenance of synaptic function). A number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Alzheimer's disease and lissencephaly share a common feature of abnormal Reelin expression in the brain. Altered Reelin expression has been hypothesized to impair neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity, leading ultimately to the cognitive deficits present in these disorders. The mechanisms for abnormal Reelin expression in some of these disorders are currently unknown although possible explanations include early developmental insults, mutations, hypermethylation of the promoter for the Reelin gene (RELN), miRNA silencing of Reelin mRNA, FMRP underexpression and Reelin processing abnormalities. Increasing Reelin expression through pharmacological therapies may help ameliorate symptoms resulting from Reelin deficits.

      "Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a major cause of developmental disabilities, severe epilepsy, and reproductive disadvantage. Genes that have been associated to MCD are mainly involved in cell proliferation and specification, neuronal migration, and late cortical organization. Lissencephaly-pachygyria-severe band heterotopia are diffuse neuronal migration disorders causing severe global neurological impairment. Abnormalities of the <i>LIS1, DCX, ARX</i>, <i>RELN</i>, <i>VLDLR</i>, <i>ACTB</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>TUBG1</i>, <i>KIF5C</i>, <i>KIF2A</i>, and <i>CDK5</i> genes have been associated with these malformations. More recent studies have also established a relationship between lissencephaly, with or without associated microcephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis as well as cerebellar hypoplasia, and at times, a morphological pattern consistent with polymicrogyria with mutations of several genes <i>(TUBA1A</i>, <i>TUBA8</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, <i>TUBB2B</i>, <i>TUBB3</i>, and <i>DYNC1H1)</i>, regulating the synthesis and function of microtubule and centrosome key components and hence defined as tubulinopathies. MCD only affecting subsets of neurons, such as mild subcortical band heterotopia and periventricular heterotopia, have been associated with abnormalities of the <i>DCX</i>, <i>FLN1A</i>, and <i>ARFGEF2</i> genes and cause neurological and cognitive impairment that vary from severe to mild deficits. Polymicrogyria results from abnormal late cortical organization and is inconstantly associated with abnormal neuronal migration. Localized polymicrogyria has been associated with anatomo-specific deficits, including disorders of language and higher cognition. Polymicrogyria is genetically heterogeneous, and only in a small minority of patients, a definite genetic cause has been identified. Megalencephaly with normal cortex or polymicrogyria by MRI imaging, hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia can all result from mutations in genes of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Postzygotic mutations have been described for most MCD and can be limited to the dysplastic tissue in the less diffuse forms.\n",

      "We review the genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their role in AD pathogenesis. More recent advances in understanding of the human genome-technologic advances in methods to analyze millions of polymorphisms in thousands of subjects-have revealed new genes associated with AD risk, including ABCA7, BIN1, CASS4, CD33, CD2AP, CELF1, CLU, CR1, DSG2, EPHA1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5-DBR1, INPP5D, MS4A, MEF2C, NME8, PICALM, PTK2B, SLC24H4-RIN3, SORL1, and ZCWPW1. Emerging technologies to analyze the entire genome in large data sets have also revealed coding variants that increase AD risk: PLD3 and TREM2. We review the relationship between these AD risk genes and the cellular and neuropathologic features of AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, classified as either early onset (under 65 years of age), or late onset (over 65 years of age). Three main genes are involved in early onset AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele has been found to be a main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes that might be potential risk factors for AD, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Recent studies have discovered additional novel genes that might be involved in late-onset AD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). Identification of new AD-related genes is important for better understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Since the differential diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders are difficult, especially in the early stages, genetic testing is essential for diagnostic processes. Next-generation sequencing studies have been successfully used for detecting mutations, monitoring the epigenetic changes, and analyzing transcriptomes. These studies may be a promising approach toward understanding the complete genetic mechanisms of diverse genetic disorders such as AD.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Whether cholesterol is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still controversial. Several studies that explored the association between lipids and/or lipid-lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ, CLU), ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7(ABCA7), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Functional cell biology studies further support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of Aβ precursor protein processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase resulting in altered Aβ production. However, conflicting evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk, randomized clinical trials observing no beneficial effect of statin therapy, and cell biology studies suggesting that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol level is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits colocalization of β-secretase 1 and Aβ precursor protein in nonraft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an Aβ-degrading enzyme. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the findings of epidemiological, genetic, and cell biology studies aiming to elucidate the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "Reelin is a large secreted glycoprotein that is essential for correct neuronal positioning during neurodevelopment and is important for synaptic plasticity in the mature brain. Moreover, Reelin is expressed in many extraneuronal tissues; yet the roles of peripheral Reelin are largely unknown. In the brain, many of Reelin's functions are mediated by a molecular signaling cascade that involves two lipoprotein receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (Apoer2) and very low density-lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr), the neuronal phosphoprotein Disabled-1 (Dab1), and members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases as crucial elements. This core signaling pathway in turn modulates the activity of adaptor proteins and downstream protein kinase cascades, many of which target the neuronal cytoskeleton. However, additional Reelin-binding receptors have been postulated or described, either as coreceptors that are essential for the activation of the \"canonical\" Reelin signaling cascade involving Apoer2/Vldlr and Dab1, or as receptors that activate alternative or additional signaling pathways. Here we will give an overview of canonical and alternative Reelin signaling pathways, molecular mechanisms involved, and their potential physiological roles in the context of different biological settings.\n",

Surprisingly, it was discovered that two LDLR family members, ApoE receptor 2 (Apoer2) and VLDL receptor (Vldlr), play key roles in brain development and adult synaptic plasticity, primarily by mediating Reelin signaling. This review focuses on Apoer2 and Vldlr signaling in the CNS and its role in human disease.\n",

      "High amylase activity in dogs is associated with a drastic increase in copy numbers of the gene coding for pancreatic amylase, AMY2B, that likely allowed dogs to thrive on a relatively starch-rich diet during early dog domestication. Although most dogs thus probably digest starch more efficiently than do wolves, AMY2B copy numbers vary widely within the dog population, and it is not clear how this variation affects the individual ability to handle starch nor how it affects dog health. In humans, copy numbers of the gene coding for salivary amylase, AMY1, correlate with both salivary amylase levels and enzyme activity, and high amylase activity is related to improved glycemic homeostasis and lower frequencies of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigate the relationship between AMY2B copy numbers and serum amylase activity in dogs and show that amylase activity correlates with AMY2B copy numbers. We then describe how AMY2B copy numbers vary in individuals from 20 dog breeds and find strong breed-dependent patterns, indicating that the ability to digest starch varies both at the breed and individual level. Finally, to test whether AMY2B copy number is strongly associated with the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, we compare copy numbers in cases and controls as well as in breeds with varying diabetes susceptibility. Although we see no such association here, future studies using larger cohorts are needed before excluding a possible link between AMY2B and diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Prolonged human interactions and artificial selection have influenced the genotypic and phenotypic diversity among dog breeds. Because humans and dogs occupy diverse habitats, ecological contexts have likely contributed to breed-specific positive selection. Prior to the advent of modern dog-feeding practices, there was likely substantial variation in dietary landscapes among disparate dog breeds. As such, we investigated one type of genetic variant, copy number variation, in three metabolic genes: glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), phytanol-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH), and pancreatic α-amylase 2B (AMY2B). These genes code for proteins that are responsible for metabolizing dietary products that originate from distinctly different food types: sugar, meat, and starch, respectively. After surveying copy number variation among dogs with diverse dietary histories, we found no correlation between diet and positive selection in either GCKR or PHYH. Although it has been previously demonstrated that dogs experienced a copy number increase in AMY2B relative to wolves during or after the dog domestication process, we demonstrate that positive selection continued to act on amylase copy number in dog breeds that consumed starch-rich diets in time periods after domestication. Furthermore, we found that introgression with wolves is not responsible for deterioration of positive selection on AMY2B among diverse dog breeds. Together, this supports the hypothesis that the amylase copy number expansion is found universally in dogs.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent, and physical exercise represents one of the most effective methods to attenuate NAFLD. However, the mechanism of aerobic exercise improving NAFLD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on CNPY2-PERK pathway in mice with NAFLD. Our study found that a high-fat diet induced NAFLD, causing an abnormal lipid metabolism and liver function injury, and increased the expressions of CNPY2, CNPY2 mRNA, PERK, PERK mRNA, p-eIF2a and CHOP. However, aerobic exercise reversesd all these parameters. These data suggest that CNPY2-PERK pathway is involved in the formation of NAFLD, and aerobic exercise can effectively improve NAFLD, which may be related to down-regulate the protein expressions of the CNPY2-PERK pathway.\n",

      "EGFL7 is a secreted angiogenic factor that is highly conserved in vertebrates. Most secreted angiogenic signaling molecules, including VEGF and fibroblast growth factor-2, are mainly expressed by non-endothelial cell types such as fibroblasts. In contrast, EGFL7 is unique because it is almost exclusively expressed by and acts on endothelial cells. Egfl7 expression is highest when the endothelium is in an active, proliferating state. This factor acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and binds to components of the extracellular matrix. In vivo, Egfl7 is important for regulating tubulogenesis in zebrafish and for controlling vascular patterning and integrity in mice. Its function in blood vessel development is mediated, at least in part, through modulation of Notch signaling. In this review, we summarize the findings that support a role for Egfl7 in developmental and postnatal angiogenesis and describe the EGFL7-signaling pathways that underlie these processes. In addition, we discuss a potential role for EGFL7 in vascular repair and its possible use as a therapeutic target for treatment of hypoxia-induced injury. Finally, we consider EGFL7 action during tumorigenesis and its potential as an antiangiogenic agent.\n",

      "Epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein 7 (EGFL7), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family, is a potent angiogenic factor expressed in many different cell types. EGFL7 plays a vital role in controlling vascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the main signaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulating evidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has been frequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma, colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression of miR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role in oncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in both the osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activities via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of its angiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, such as ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.\n",

      "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis and permeability should enable the development of more effective therapies for various diseases, including retinopathy, cancer, and other vascular disorders. We focused on epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) which plays an important role in NOTCH signaling and in the organization of angiogenic sprouts. We developed an EGFL7-knockdown in vitro microvessel model and investigated the effect of EGFL7 at a tissue level. We found EGFL7 knockdown suppressed VEGF-A-induced sprouting angiogenesis accompanied by an overproduction of endothelial filopodia and reduced collagen IV deposition at the basal side of endothelial cells. We also observed impaired barrier function which reflected an inflammatory condition. Furthermore, our results showed that proper formation of adherens junctions and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was disturbed. In conclusion, by using a 3D microvessel model we identified novel roles for EGFL7 in endothelial function during sprouting angiogenesis.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is responsible for uptake of cholesterol-carrying lipoprotein particles into cells. The receptor binds lipoprotein particles at the cell surface and releases them in the low-pH environment of the endosome. The focus of the current review is on biochemical and structural studies of the LDLR and its ligands, emphasizing how structural features of the receptor dictate the binding of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and beta-migrating forms of very low-density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) particles, how the receptor releases bound ligands at low pH, and how the cytoplasmic tail of the LDLR interfaces with the endocytic machinery.\n",

      "It is now about 20 years since the first case of a gain-of-function mutation involving the as-yet-unknown actor in cholesterol homeostasis, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), was described. It was soon clear that this protein would have been of huge scientific and clinical value as a therapeutic strategy for dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) management. Indeed, PCSK9 is a serine protease belonging to the proprotein convertase family, mainly produced by the liver, and essential for metabolism of LDL particles by inhibiting LDL receptor (LDLR) recirculation to the cell surface with the consequent upregulation of LDLR-dependent LDL-C levels. Beyond its effects on LDL metabolism, several studies revealed the existence of additional roles of PCSK9 in different stages of atherosclerosis, also for its ability to target other members of the LDLR family. PCSK9 from plasma and vascular cells can contribute to the development of atherosclerotic plaque and thrombosis by promoting platelet activation, leukocyte recruitment and clot formation, also through mechanisms not related to systemic lipid changes. These results further supported the value for the potential cardiovascular benefits of therapies based on PCSK9 inhibition. Actually, the passive immunization with anti-PCSK9 antibodies, evolocumab and alirocumab, is shown to be effective in dramatically reducing the LDL-C levels and attenuating CVD. While monoclonal antibodies sequester circulating PCSK9, inclisiran, a small interfering RNA, is a new drug that inhibits PCSK9 synthesis with the important advantage, compared with PCSK9 mAbs, to preserve its pharmacodynamic effects when administrated every 6 months. Here, we will focus on the major understandings related to PCSK9, from its discovery to its role in lipoprotein metabolism, involvement in atherothrombosis and a brief excursus on approved current therapies used to inhibit its action.\n",

      "The angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4 and 8 have emerged as key regulators of plasma lipid metabolism by serving as potent inhibitors of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In this review, we provide an integrated picture of the role of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 in lipid metabolism by focusing on their impact on LPL activity and plasma triglyceride clearance during physiological conditions such as fasting, refeeding, exercise and cold exposure.\n",
      "Upon refeeding, circulating ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 promote the replenishment of white adipose tissue depots by specifically inhibiting LPL activity in oxidative tissues. During exercise and cold exposure, ANGPTL4 represses local LPL activity to assure that plasma triglycerides are specifically shuttled to exercising muscle and brown adipose tissue, respectively. Overall, ANGPTL4 is the central component of a fatty acid-driven feedback mechanism that regulates plasma triglyceride hydrolysis and subsequent tissue fatty acid uptake in response to changes in lipid availability and cellular fuel demand.\n",
      "ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8 together ensure that triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are adequately distributed during different physiological conditions. The impact of the ANGPTLs on plasma lipid levels has led to scrutiny of ANGPTLs as therapeutic targets for dyslipidemia.\n",

      "Microglia, once viewed as static bystanders with limited homeostatic functions, are now considered key players in the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial activation is a salient feature of neuroinflammation involving a dynamic process that generates multitudinous microglial phenotypes that can respond to a variety of situational cues in the central nervous system. Recently, a flurry of single cell RNA-sequencing studies have defined microglial phenotypes in unprecedented detail, and have highlighted robust changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Increased expression of genes such as Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) in microglia during development, damage, and disease, suggest that increased lipid metabolism is needed to fuel protective cellular functions such as phagocytosis. This review describes our current understanding of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in microglia, and highlights microglial lipid metabolism as a modifiable target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.\n",

      "A major step in energy metabolism is hydrolysis of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) to release fatty acids that can be used or stored. This is accomplished by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at 'binding lipolysis sites' at the vascular endothelium. A multitude of interactions are involved in this seemingly simple reaction. Recent advances in the understanding of some of these factors will be discussed in an attempt to build a comprehensive picture.\n",
      "The first event in catabolism of TRLs is that they dock at the vascular endothelium. This requires LPL and GPIHBP1, the endothelial transporter of LPL.Kinetic studies in rats with labeled chylomicrons showed that once a chylomicron has docked in the heart it stays for minutes and a large number of triacylglycerol molecules are split. The distribution of binding between tissues reflects the amount of LPL, as evident from studies with mutant mice.Clearance of TRLs is often slowed down in metabolic disease, as was demonstrated both in mice and men. In mice, this was directly connected to decreased amounts of endothelial LPL.\n",

      "The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is the founding member of a family of seven structurally closely related transmembrane proteins (LRP1, LRP1b, megalin/LRP2, LDL receptor, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, MEGF7/LRP4, LRP8/apolipoprotein E receptor2). These proteins participate in a wide range of physiological processes, including the regulation of lipid metabolism, protection against atherosclerosis, neurodevelopment, and transport of nutrients and vitamins. While currently available data suggest that the role of the LDL receptor is limited to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles, there is growing experimental evidence that the other members of the gene family have additional physiological functions as signal transducers. In this review, we focus on the latest discovered functions of two major members of this family, LRP1 and megalin/LRP2, and on the newly elucidated physiological role of a third member of the family, MEGF7/LRP4, which can also function as a modulator of diverse signaling pathways during development.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized with progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature that occurs prior to neurodegeneration and memory dysfunction. Mounting evidence suggests that aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau leads to synaptic deficits and neurodegeneration, thereby to memory loss. Among the established genetic risk factors for AD, the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor. We and others previously demonstrated that apoE regulates Aβ aggregation and clearance in an isoform-dependent manner. While the effect of apoE on Aβ may explain how apoE isoforms differentially affect AD pathogenesis, there are also other underexplored pathogenic mechanisms. They include differential effects of apoE on cerebral energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, neurovascular function, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. ApoE is a major carrier of cholesterols that are required for neuronal activity and injury repair in the brain. Although there are a few conflicting findings and the underlying mechanism is still unclear, several lines of studies demonstrated that apoE4 leads to synaptic deficits and impairment in long-term potentiation, memory and cognition. In this review, we summarize current understanding of apoE function in the brain, with a particular emphasis on its role in synaptic plasticity and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, involving low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), syndecan, and LRP8/ApoER2.\n",

      "The LDL receptor gene family constitutes a class of structurally closely related cell surface receptors fulfilling diverse functions in different organs, tissues, and cell types. The LDL receptor is the prototype of this family, which also includes the VLDLR, ApoER2/LRP8, LRP1 and LRP1B, as well as Megalin/GP330, SorLA/LR11, LRP5, LRP6 and MEGF7. Recently several lines of evidence have positioned the LDL receptor gene family as one of the key players in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Initially this receptor family was of high interest due to its key function in cholesterol/apolipoprotein E (ApoE) uptake, with the epsilon4 allele of ApoE as the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. It has been established that the cholesterol metabolism of the cell has a strong impact on the production of Abeta, the major component of the plaques found in the brain of AD-patients. The original report that soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing the kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain might act as a ligand for LRP1 led to a complex investigation of the interaction of both proteins and their potential function in AD development. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that LRP1 might bind to APP independent of the KPI domain in APP. This APP - LRP1 interaction is facilitated through a trimeric complex of APP-FE65-LRP1, which has a functional role in APP processing. Along with LRP1, APP is transported from the early secretory compartments to the cell surface and subsequently internalised into the endosomal / lysosomal compartments. Recent investigations indicate that ApoER2 and SorLA fulfil a similar role in shifting APP localisation in the cell, which affects APP processing and the production of the APP derived amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). In addition to the effect of lipoprotein receptors on APP processing and Abeta production, LRP1 has been shown to bind Abeta directly or indirectly through Abeta-lactoferrin, Abeta-alpha2M and Abeta-ApoE complexes in vitro and in vivo. Based on these observations two LRP1 mediated clearance mechanisms of Abeta are proposed to play a crucial role in the prevention of AD: either Abeta-uptake into a cell with its subsequent degradation or its transport out of the brain over the blood brain barrier into the periphery. Following this export Abeta is degraded in the liver, where LRP1 potentially conducts the removal of Abeta from the blood stream. Although the involvement of LDLR family members in AD is not yet fully understood it becomes clear that they can directly affect APP production, Abeta-clearance and Abeta-transport over the blood brain barrier.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) binds to LDL receptor (LDLR) and targets it for lysosomal degradation in cells. Decreased hepatic clearance of plasma LDL-cholesterol is the primary gauge of PCSK9 activity in humans; however, PCSK9's evolutionary role may extend to other lipoprotein classes and processes. This review highlights studies that are providing novel insights into physiological regulation of PCSK9 transcription and plasma PCSK9 activity.\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that circulating PCSK9 binds to apolipoprotein B100 on LDL particles, which in turn inhibits PCSK9's ability to bind to cell surface LDLRs. Negative feedback of secreted PCSK9 activity by LDL could serve to increase plasma excursion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and monitor lipoprotein remodeling. Recent findings have identified hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α as a key transcriptional regulator that cooperates with sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 to control PCSK9 expression in hepatocytes in response to nutritional and hormonal inputs, as well as acute inflammation.\n",
      "PCSK9 is an established target for cholesterol-lowering therapies. Further study of PCSK9 regulatory mechanisms may identify additional control points for pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. PCSK9 function could reflect ancient roles in the fasting-feeding cycle and in linking lipoprotein metabolism with innate immunity.\n",

      "The SREBP2/LDLR pathway is sensitive to cholesterol content in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while membrane low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is influenced by sterol response element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL). LDL-C, one of the risk factors in cardiovascular disease, is cleared through endocytosis recycling of LDLR. Therefore, we propose that a balance between LDLR endocytosis recycling and PCSK9-mediated and IDOL-mediated lysosomal LDLR degradation is responsible for cholesterol homeostasis in the ER. For statins that decrease serum LDL-C levels via cholesterol synthesis inhibition, the mechanism by which the statins increase the membrane LDLR may be regulated by cholesterol homeostasis in the ER.\n",

      "Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A(2) (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting diet-induced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b(+/+) and Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, PPAR-delta, PPAR-gamma, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Excessive absorption of products of dietary fat digestion leads to type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related disorders. Mice deficient in the group 1B phospholipase A₂ (Pla2g1b), a gut digestive enzyme, are protected against diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes without displaying dietary lipid malabsorption. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Pla2g1b protects against diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Results showed that the Pla2g1b(-/-) mice had decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice subsequent to feeding a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (hypercaloric) diet. These differences were evident before differences in body weight gains were observed. Injection of Poloxamer 407 to inhibit lipolysis revealed decreased VLDL production in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice. Supplementation with lysophosphatidylcholine, the product of Pla2g1b hydrolysis, restored VLDL production rates in Pla2g1b(-/-) mice and further elevated VLDL production in Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. The Pla2g1b(-/-) mice also displayed decreased postprandial lipidemia compared with Pla2g1b(+/+) mice. These results show that, in addition to dietary fatty acids, gut-derived lysophospholipids derived from Pla2g1b hydrolysis of dietary and biliary phospholipids also promote hepatic VLDL production. Thus, the inhibition of lysophospholipid absorption via Pla2g1b inactivation may prove beneficial against diet-induced hyperlipidemia in addition to the protection against obesity and diabetes.\n",

      "Immunity to intestinal helminth infections has been well studied, but the mechanism of helminth killing prior to expulsion remains unclear. Here we identify epithelial-cell-derived phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> group 1B (PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B) as a host-derived endogenous anthelmintic. PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B is elevated in resistant mice and is responsible for killing tissue-embedded larvae. Despite comparable activities of other essential type-2-dependent immune mechanisms, Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to expel the intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Expression of Pla2g1b by epithelial cells was dependent upon intestinal microbiota, adaptive immunity, and common-gamma chain-dependent signaling. Notably, Pla2g1b was downregulated in susceptible mice and inhibited by IL-4R-signaling in vitro, uncoupling parasite killing from expulsion mechanisms. Resistance was restored in Pla2g1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice by treating infective H. polygyrus L3 larvae with PLA<sub>2</sub>g1B, which reduced larval phospholipid abundance. These findings uncover epithelial-cell-derived Pla2g1b as an essential mediator of helminth killing, highlighting a previously overlooked mechanism of anti-helminth immunity.\n",

      "Reelin is a glycoprotein that serves important roles both during development (regulation of neuronal migration and brain lamination) and in adulthood (maintenance of synaptic function). A number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Alzheimer's disease and lissencephaly share a common feature of abnormal Reelin expression in the brain. Altered Reelin expression has been hypothesized to impair neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity, leading ultimately to the cognitive deficits present in these disorders. The mechanisms for abnormal Reelin expression in some of these disorders are currently unknown although possible explanations include early developmental insults, mutations, hypermethylation of the promoter for the Reelin gene (RELN), miRNA silencing of Reelin mRNA, FMRP underexpression and Reelin processing abnormalities. Increasing Reelin expression through pharmacological therapies may help ameliorate symptoms resulting from Reelin deficits.

      "Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a major cause of developmental disabilities, severe epilepsy, and reproductive disadvantage. Genes that have been associated to MCD are mainly involved in cell proliferation and specification, neuronal migration, and late cortical organization. Lissencephaly-pachygyria-severe band heterotopia are diffuse neuronal migration disorders causing severe global neurological impairment. Abnormalities of the <i>LIS1, DCX, ARX</i>, <i>RELN</i>, <i>VLDLR</i>, <i>ACTB</i>, <i>ACTG1</i>, <i>TUBG1</i>, <i>KIF5C</i>, <i>KIF2A</i>, and <i>CDK5</i> genes have been associated with these malformations. More recent studies have also established a relationship between lissencephaly, with or without associated microcephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis as well as cerebellar hypoplasia, and at times, a morphological pattern consistent with polymicrogyria with mutations of several genes <i>(TUBA1A</i>, <i>TUBA8</i>, <i>TUBB</i>, <i>TUBB2B</i>, <i>TUBB3</i>, and <i>DYNC1H1)</i>, regulating the synthesis and function of microtubule and centrosome key components and hence defined as tubulinopathies. MCD only affecting subsets of neurons, such as mild subcortical band heterotopia and periventricular heterotopia, have been associated with abnormalities of the <i>DCX</i>, <i>FLN1A</i>, and <i>ARFGEF2</i> genes and cause neurological and cognitive impairment that vary from severe to mild deficits. Polymicrogyria results from abnormal late cortical organization and is inconstantly associated with abnormal neuronal migration. Localized polymicrogyria has been associated with anatomo-specific deficits, including disorders of language and higher cognition. Polymicrogyria is genetically heterogeneous, and only in a small minority of patients, a definite genetic cause has been identified. Megalencephaly with normal cortex or polymicrogyria by MRI imaging, hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia can all result from mutations in genes of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Postzygotic mutations have been described for most MCD and can be limited to the dysplastic tissue in the less diffuse forms.\n",

      "We review the genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their role in AD pathogenesis. More recent advances in understanding of the human genome-technologic advances in methods to analyze millions of polymorphisms in thousands of subjects-have revealed new genes associated with AD risk, including ABCA7, BIN1, CASS4, CD33, CD2AP, CELF1, CLU, CR1, DSG2, EPHA1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5-DBR1, INPP5D, MS4A, MEF2C, NME8, PICALM, PTK2B, SLC24H4-RIN3, SORL1, and ZCWPW1. Emerging technologies to analyze the entire genome in large data sets have also revealed coding variants that increase AD risk: PLD3 and TREM2. We review the relationship between these AD risk genes and the cellular and neuropathologic features of AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, classified as either early onset (under 65 years of age), or late onset (over 65 years of age). Three main genes are involved in early onset AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele has been found to be a main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes that might be potential risk factors for AD, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Recent studies have discovered additional novel genes that might be involved in late-onset AD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). Identification of new AD-related genes is important for better understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Since the differential diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders are difficult, especially in the early stages, genetic testing is essential for diagnostic processes. Next-generation sequencing studies have been successfully used for detecting mutations, monitoring the epigenetic changes, and analyzing transcriptomes. These studies may be a promising approach toward understanding the complete genetic mechanisms of diverse genetic disorders such as AD.\n",

      "Whether cholesterol is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still controversial. Several studies that explored the association between lipids and/or lipid-lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ, CLU), ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7(ABCA7), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Functional cell biology studies further support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of Aβ precursor protein processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase resulting in altered Aβ production. However, conflicting evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk, randomized clinical trials observing no beneficial effect of statin therapy, and cell biology studies suggesting that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol level is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits colocalization of β-secretase 1 and Aβ precursor protein in nonraft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an Aβ-degrading enzyme. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the findings of epidemiological, genetic, and cell biology studies aiming to elucidate the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD.\n",

      "High amylase activity in dogs is associated with a drastic increase in copy numbers of the gene coding for pancreatic amylase, AMY2B, that likely allowed dogs to thrive on a relatively starch-rich diet during early dog domestication. Although most dogs thus probably digest starch more efficiently than do wolves, AMY2B copy numbers vary widely within the dog population, and it is not clear how this variation affects the individual ability to handle starch nor how it affects dog health. In humans, copy numbers of the gene coding for salivary amylase, AMY1, correlate with both salivary amylase levels and enzyme activity, and high amylase activity is related to improved glycemic homeostasis and lower frequencies of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigate the relationship between AMY2B copy numbers and serum amylase activity in dogs and show that amylase activity correlates with AMY2B copy numbers. We then describe how AMY2B copy numbers vary in individuals from 20 dog breeds and find strong breed-dependent patterns, indicating that the ability to digest starch varies both at the breed and individual level. Finally, to test whether AMY2B copy number is strongly associated with the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, we compare copy numbers in cases and controls as well as in breeds with varying diabetes susceptibility. Although we see no such association here, future studies using larger cohorts are needed before excluding a possible link between AMY2B and diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Prolonged human interactions and artificial selection have influenced the genotypic and phenotypic diversity among dog breeds. Because humans and dogs occupy diverse habitats, ecological contexts have likely contributed to breed-specific positive selection. Prior to the advent of modern dog-feeding practices, there was likely substantial variation in dietary landscapes among disparate dog breeds. As such, we investigated one type of genetic variant, copy number variation, in three metabolic genes: glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), phytanol-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH), and pancreatic α-amylase 2B (AMY2B). These genes code for proteins that are responsible for metabolizing dietary products that originate from distinctly different food types: sugar, meat, and starch, respectively. After surveying copy number variation among dogs with diverse dietary histories, we found no correlation between diet and positive selection in either GCKR or PHYH. Although it has been previously demonstrated that dogs experienced a copy number increase in AMY2B relative to wolves during or after the dog domestication process, we demonstrate that positive selection continued to act on amylase copy number in dog breeds that consumed starch-rich diets in time periods after domestication. Furthermore, we found that introgression with wolves is not responsible for deterioration of positive selection on AMY2B among diverse dog breeds. Together, this supports the hypothesis that the amylase copy number expansion is found universally in dogs.\n",

      "The LDLR is a critical factor in the regulation of blood cholesterol levels that are altered in different human diseases. The level of LDLR in the cell is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.\n",

      "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent, and physical exercise represents one of the most effective methods to attenuate NAFLD. However, the mechanism of aerobic exercise improving NAFLD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on CNPY2-PERK pathway in mice with NAFLD. Our study found that a high-fat diet induced NAFLD, causing an abnormal lipid metabolism and liver function injury, and increased the expressions of CNPY2, CNPY2 mRNA, PERK, PERK mRNA, p-eIF2a and CHOP. However, aerobic exercise reversesd all these parameters. These data suggest that CNPY2-PERK pathway is involved in the formation of NAFLD, and aerobic exercise can effectively improve NAFLD, which may be related to down-regulate the protein expressions of the CNPY2-PERK pathway.\n",

      "EGFL7 is a secreted angiogenic factor that is highly conserved in vertebrates. Most secreted angiogenic signaling molecules, including VEGF and fibroblast growth factor-2, are mainly expressed by non-endothelial cell types such as fibroblasts. In contrast, EGFL7 is unique because it is almost exclusively expressed by and acts on endothelial cells. Egfl7 expression is highest when the endothelium is in an active, proliferating state. This factor acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and binds to components of the extracellular matrix. In vivo, Egfl7 is important for regulating tubulogenesis in zebrafish and for controlling vascular patterning and integrity in mice. Its function in blood vessel development is mediated, at least in part, through modulation of Notch signaling. In this review, we summarize the findings that support a role for Egfl7 in developmental and postnatal angiogenesis and describe the EGFL7-signaling pathways that underlie these processes. In addition, we discuss a potential role for EGFL7 in vascular repair and its possible use as a therapeutic target for treatment of hypoxia-induced injury. Finally, we consider EGFL7 action during tumorigenesis and its potential as an antiangiogenic agent.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein 7 (EGFL7), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family, is a potent angiogenic factor expressed in many different cell types. EGFL7 plays a vital role in controlling vascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the main signaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulating evidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has been frequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma, colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression of miR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role in oncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in both the osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activities via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of its angiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, such as ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.\n",

      "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis and permeability should enable the development of more effective therapies for various diseases, including retinopathy, cancer, and other vascular disorders. We focused on epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) which plays an important role in NOTCH signaling and in the organization of angiogenic sprouts. We developed an EGFL7-knockdown in vitro microvessel model and investigated the effect of EGFL7 at a tissue level. We found EGFL7 knockdown suppressed VEGF-A-induced sprouting angiogenesis accompanied by an overproduction of endothelial filopodia and reduced collagen IV deposition at the basal side of endothelial cells. We also observed impaired barrier function which reflected an inflammatory condition. Furthermore, our results showed that proper formation of adherens junctions and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was disturbed. In conclusion, by using a 3D microvessel model we identified novel roles for EGFL7 in endothelial function during sprouting angiogenesis.\n",

      "Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between uptake, efflux, and endogenous synthesis. Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.\n",

      "The LDLR family of proteins is involved in lipoproteins trafficking. While the role of LDLR in cardiovascular disease has been widely studied, only recently the role of other members of the LDLR proteins in lipoprotein homeostasis and atherosclerosis has emerged. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRPs bind and internalize apoE- and apoB-containing lipoprotein, including LDL and VLDL, and regulate their cellular uptake. LRP6 is a unique member of this family for its function as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. The work in our laboratory has shown that LRP6 also plays a key role in lipoprotein and TG clearance, glucose homoeostasis, and atherosclerosis. The role of these receptor proteins in pathogenesis of diverse metabolic risk factors is emerging, rendering them targets of novel therapeutics for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. This manuscript reviews the physiological role of the LDLR family of proteins and describes its involvement in pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.\n",
